Bosh will spend \"the next few days\" reviewing options and no determination will be made about his playing status until he goes through more tests and evaluation, a person with knowledge of the situation told  on Monday night. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because neither the All-Star forward nor the Heat have revealed the concerns publicly.  Bosh is Miami's leading scorer at 19.1 points per game this season. He said over the weekend in Toronto that he was optimistic about playing again this season.  Bosh pulled out of the All-Star Game and the 3-point contest over the weekend because of what he and the Heat described as a calf strain. He was shut down at the All-Star break last season because a blood clot had found its way to one of his lungs, and that issue is something that Bosh believes started as a calf problem.  He went to Toronto expecting to participate in All-Star weekend, then was examined there -- presumably because of the calf pain -- and the NBA subsequently announced on Friday afternoon that Bosh was withdrawing from the game and the 3-point event. Bosh remained in Toronto to cheer on his Eastern Conference teammates, then returned to Miami and met with team medical personnel Monday.  \"The biggest thing is his health,\" Heat teammate  said Saturday in Toronto, when the speculation was that Bosh was only dealing with a strain. \"All in all, as I said last year, it's bigger than basketball. It's about his family and he has to make sure he does everything right. I want to make sure that he's doing whatever he needs to do to be healthy and get back on the basketball court whenever he's ready.\"  The fact that Bosh remained in Toronto, and was active over the course of the weekend, suggests he's at least optimistic that the problem -- whether it's a clot or not -- can be managed. He was on the bench for the All-Star Game, was in uniform for the team photo session pregame, accompanied Wade to a dinner that honored  on Saturday night and moved around without any obvious difficulty.  Last year, that wasn't the case.  \"I couldn't walk anywhere,\" Bosh said in September, describing how the clot affected him. \"I was in too much pain.\"  Bosh has taken precautions over the last year to try and prevent the recurrence of a clot, including partnering with Janssen Pharmaceuticals -- the maker of the commonly used blood thinner Xarelto -- to educate people about the risks. After the clot last season was found, Bosh started taking that blood thinner for several months as part of his recovery.  Athletes in contact sports typically cannot play while taking blood thinners.

It has been a long, difficult road back to the rising star he was before a bone in his right leg popped through his skin on that August night in Las Vegas. Surrounded by so many of those elite faces again in Toronto on Sunday night, George has never looked more like the player that has made the Indiana Pacers relevant again. Truth be told, he looked even better.  George led all players with 41 points and made nine 3-pointers in the East's 196-173 loss to West, finishing one basket shy of breaking Wilt Chamberlain's single-game All-Star scoring record.  \"For me to be here just being back as an All-Star was special. But to be able to put on a show and have fun and enjoy this moment, get back to playing how I play pre-injury is special,\" George said. \"I've just been blessed. I'm very thankful and very grateful.\"  Oklahoma City guard  won the MVP award with 31 points in the victory, but it was George who stood out above all of the game's best players, just like he did before his right leg awkwardly hit the basketball stanchion in that USA scrimmage, bringing tears to his teammates' eyes.  \"I had a hard-fought summer, hard-fought rehab year,\" George said. \"It was just a very upward climb. It took every day and really every moment of rehab to get through it. There were a lot of days where I felt like I was down and out, but just stayed with it.\"  Thanks to George's emergence as one of the NBA's bright young stars, the Pacers had climbed up the Eastern Conference ladder to assert themselves as legitimate challengers. George had a great chance to be in Team USA's plans for the London Olympics, but his leg snapped grotesquely and had many, including George himself, wondering if he would ever play again.  He missed all but six games last season, but his ability to return even for the end of the season was a shock in and of itself. Playing in those games gave him a chance to get a little bit of confidence back, to believe that returning to basketball's highest level was possible, and he took off like a rocket at the start of this season.  While he was injured, George worked on two of his game's weaknesses - ball-handling and perimeter shooting. He returned this season a more well-rounded player and averaged 29.5 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists in the first month of the season. Those numbers have dipped expectedly as the season has worn on, but George has his swagger back.  \"He's back,\" Pelicans star  said. \"The way he shoots the ball, the way he attacks the rim, his game is very unique. Basically he was showing guys tonight that he's back to rare form.\"  On a night where all eyes started on Lakers star  in his 18th and final All-Star game, they couldn't help but drift on to George as the shots kept falling and the ball kept finding him.  Both teams broke the previous record for points in a game, with the West eclipsing the previous mark with eight minutes to go in the fourth quarter. Defense wasn't an afterthought, it was never even considered - except in the final 30 seconds.  Sitting on 41 points, George had the ball on the right wing, needing one bucket to surpass Chamberlain's mark set in 1962. That's when Golden State Warriors forward  got right in George's face, hounding him all over the court in the only possession of defense played the entire game.  \"We don't want any records like that broken on us,\" Green said with a chuckle. \"Just trying to contest the shot.\" "},

If you're thinking this is about , who's taking bows here in his 20th and final season, well, yes, in a sense, but not in this instance.  Jim Naismith is the grandson of James Naismith and he took home a few parting gifts from the All-Star Game. One was a basketball signed by players on the East and West squads and handed over by .  The other was the confirmation that what his grandfather did many decades ago is still being enjoyed by fans as it continues to go through evolutionary stages, which was fairly evident during the most festive NBA weekend in Canada history.  \"Oh, if he could see what has become of the game. He'd be amazed,\" said the grandson, who watched from the second row. \"The players, the athleticism, the skill, it's all on such a high level. I think he'd be pleased.\"  The first All-Star Weekend north of the border was well received based purely on turnout and turnt-up. It helped that the game itself had a predetermined theme, thanks to the fans who had sympathy for an old man and appreciation for what he has done to Naismith's creation. They voted Kobe as a starter, and he indeed heard the loudest applause and felt the love from both squads, and wait a minute, DID AARON GORDON REALLY PLUCK A BALL FROM THE SCALP OF A FURRY ANIMAL AND GO UNDER HIS LEGS FOR THAT SLAM?  Sorry. Dunk contest hangover. It was just bittersweet being out there on the floor with him, knowing that the matches between us two are coming to an end soon.\u2013 LeBron James on sharing the All-Star Game court with Kobe Bryant Where were we? Yes: Kobe was the clear headliner; right from the jump, and literally at that, the game was tailored to suit him. When Magic Johnson grabbed the mic and said farewell, and a video montage played on the big screen before the start, and West coach Gregg Popovich had Kobe compete in the opening tap against LeBron James, this was designed to be about an 18-time All-Star and four-time All-Star MVP.  \"It was just bittersweet being out there on the floor with him,\" said LeBron, \"knowing that the matches between us two are coming to an end soon.\"  The East squad took it easy on Kobe, and on several occasions almost begged him to posterize them. But Kobe is an old 37 with heavy tread and admittedly is done with trying to prove anything to anyone; that tank dried up soon after he realized the obvious and announced his retirement. And so the night was about being playful, taking LeBron's dare and going one-on-one during a sequence, and throwing lobs, and managing to get up and down the floor without signaling to the bench for a breather. Kobe's Big NightHighlights of Kobe Bryant from his 18th appearance and final All-Star game. \"I had a blast playing with those guys, laughing and joking on the bench,\" he said. \"A great, great time.\"  The West nearly rolled up 200 points, and in a game that saw his team win 196-173, Kobe scored 10 points and left it to the next generation to handle it from here. Therefore,  snatched a second consecutive MVP, becoming the first to do so outright. And , less than two years removed from a horrific broken leg, came one point shy of matching Wilt Chamberlain's All-Star Game scoring record of 42 points.  \"I don't believe he had surgery, personally,\" said LeBron, laughing.  And Steph Curry sent everyone home with a half-court shot in the final seconds, to remind the basketball world of what he and the Warriors are capable of doing. In case anyone forgot.  It was the rare All-Star Game that took a backseat to All-Star Saturday and specifically the most tantalizing dunk contest in years if not ever. After a center, Karl-Anthony Towns, won the skills contest, and  upstaged Curry in the 3-point contest, something more improbably happened. Gordon and defending champ  posted more 10s than you'll ever see on a model runway. I had a blast playing with those guys, laughing and joking on the bench. A great, great time.\u2013 Kobe Bryant on his final All-Star Game \"We did some things that nobody else did,\" said LaVine.  In some way, Kobe had a role in the basketball life of LaVine and Gordon and Towns and almost everyone who was involved in All-Star Weekend. Most of them grew up on Kobe, or became fixated with him, and certainly learned something from him. As he soaked everything in during the weekend, Kobe said he's happy to leave the game in good hands.  \"As far as the league, when we first came in, the elder statesmen said this younger generation has no idea what they're doing, they're going to kill the game,\" said Kobe. \"When we came in, we were just young kids that wanted to play. It was a new generation, newer culture, but I think where the game ended up, it ended up in a beautiful place. The game is in a beautiful place now.\" Postgame: Kobe Bryant5-time NBA Champion Kobe Bryant speaks following his final All-Star game. It seems that way. Thousands came to honor Kobe and the game itself all weekend, braving sub-zero temperatures that froze the entire city but was powerless against the desire to see basketball. Sometimes All-Star Weekend can be hit-and-miss, and the Saturday events fall flat, and the game endures brutal stretches. But not this weekend. This was one of the better ones.  This was one to savor, because of Gordon and LaVine, and a half-court shot from Curry, and the tributes for Kobe. Absorbing it all first-hand was a man with a very familiar and important last name.  \"This is a great game,\" said Jim Naismith. \"And it keeps getting better.\"  A Canadian named James Naismith made it possible for one generation after another to put its unique touch on a game that began with a ball and a peach basket. As we saw over the weekend, his invention was, and remains, a slam dunk. "},

The Denver Nuggets were playing the Orlando Magic as Mudiay's rookie season was getting snowed under by turnovers and missed shots. He was playing big minutes while coach Michael Malone resolutely stood behind the , he was defending in the part of his game that was living up to expectations, and he remained a major prospect, but Mudiay was not in a good place.  \"I don't know,\" he said, searching for the exact description. \"I wasn't feeling like myself. I was struggling a little bit.\"  Not with the ball, Mudiay meant. Emotionally.  It couldn't have been the trying adjustment to life on his own as a 19-year-old in the NBA because Mudiay had done the real canyon jump the season before by playing in China rather than fight the NCAA over eligibility issues to spend a planned freshman campaign at SMU. It couldn't have been the physical challenge of facing adults because Mudiay arrived -- at 6-foot-5, 200-pounds -- was a point guard with athleticism and an NBA body. They would have to contend with him just as much as the other way around.  And then he , three nights after facing the Magic. Mudiay was sidelined for 14 games.  A strange thing happened.  He got better by doing nothing. I could care less about what people think about my shot or what not. I'm going to work on my game and just focus on what I need to focus on. It comes with it.\u2013 Denver Nuggets rookie guard Emmanuel Mudiay Not actually nothing. By not playing. Mudiay had no choice but to watch from a different perspective. The game slowed down. The mind cleared.  When he returned Jan. 10, it was with a promise to himself: Play your game no matter what happens, without the problems on offense becoming a weight increasing by the night, and be happy with what you've got to do. Have fun on the court again, like all the other years.  Now Mudiay is asked whether he is surprised by the amount of turnovers and says, \"A little bit. But I'm going to play my brand of basketball. That's just being in attack mode and taking risks. Sometimes those risks cause turnovers. But sometimes they don't. It's just a matter of learning how to play.\"  He is asked about struggling to hit a shot and says, \"I'm just playing basketball. I could care less about what people think about my shot or what not. I'm going to work on my game and just focus on what I need to focus on. It comes with it. Some games you make some shots, some games you've got to figure it out. That's about it.\"  And he is asked how good he can eventually be and says, \"I'll be great.\"  Mudiay is feeling like himself all right. Just as he accepted the premise  -- embraced it, actually -- he would bask in the walk on the high wire eight months later while heading into the .  It doesn't hurt he made the game in a vote of the league's assistant coaches despite , a credibility boost whether he wanted it or not, but Mudiay wasn't flinching anyway. It doesn't hurt that the native of the Democratic Republic of Congo was regarded among the best rookies and second-year players for the World roster that will face the U.S. team with the same experience mix on Friday night at Air Canada Centre even when his turnover problem may have been more severe than the field-goal problem the first couple months, but Mudiay had already blinked away the harsh critiques of his offense.  Being in attack mode and taking risks.  \"I could care less about what people think about my shot or what not.\"  \"I'll be great.\"  The real credibility boost for Mudiay, the real statement that he is pointed in the right direction, in play and attitude, is what has happened on the court, not the ballot box. His numbers improved dramatically in the first 16 games since returning to the lineup. Mudiay has gone from 31 percent from the field pre-injury to 37.6 percent since and improvedhis assist-to-turnover ratio (1.5-to-1 to 2-to-1) and scoring (10.7 points to 12.3 points) all while his minutes went climbed (29.0 to 31.6). The shooting in particular remained an issue as a projected problem before the Draft come to life, but at least were clearly steering up.  The sprained ankle turned into a re-start. His mood got better and his game got better, while his attitude of charging straight ahead remained intact. He will be great, right? He says it with a certainty, without having to search for the exact description.      "},
{"url": "http://www.nba.com/2016/news/features/steve_aschburner/02/12/league-has-healthy-outlook-but-a-check-up-is-needed/index.html", "text": "  \u2014 These are fat times for the NBA. More money is pulsing through the system and into players' and teams' pockets than ever before. The league never has been more avidly and widely followed, domestically and globally, using whatever metric you prefer.  Which means this is precisely the right time for commissioner Adam Silver, the owners and executives of the 30 franchises, NBA players union chief Michele Roberts and the league's approximately 450 players to be on high alert against that grave and all-too-familiar threat to any successful enterprise: Complacency.  It was inventor Thomas Edison, after all, who kept prodding himself and said, \"We shall have no better conditions in the future if we are satisfied with all those which we have at the present.\" Or as former GE chairman Jack Welch said more succinctly, \"Change before you have to.\"  It really isn't necessary to quote chapter and verse on the NBA's popular and fiscal well-being. But here are some of the essentials: A bonanza of a TV rights deal with ESPN and Turner Sports -- a , nearly tripling the current annual take -- kicks in for next season and runs through 2024-25. Average player salaries, after hovering for several seasons near $5 million, will break $6 million, then $7 million and $8 million, all in over a few years.  Franchise valuations are at nosebleed levels, with Forbes calculating an average of $1.25 billion, triple what they were just four years ago. . Five have soared to or beyond $2 billion. And 29 of the 30 teams, per Forbes, currently are running in the black, with Brooklyn paying now for recent largesse. Inside The NBA: SIlver On Social MediaCommissioner Silver talks about the evolution of the NBA, Golden State's success and online betting.  \"There's never been a better time to be an owner of an NBA franchise \u2014 or, frankly, any professional sports team,\" Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis, chairman of the league's media committee, said after the new TV deal was announced.  Expansion isn't in the offing, as commissioner Adam Silver likely will mention again in his annual state-of-the-NBA news conference to tip off the evening . But if it were, the expansion fee asked of a new entrant in Seattle, Las Vegas or wherever would be, what, $1 billion? Maybe $1.5 billion? More? Consider: The last time the NBA expanded, Charlotte bought back in as the league's 30th team in 2004 for $300 million. Per Forbes, that franchise is estimated to be worth $750 million today.  Facilities around the league range from venerably refurbished (Madison Square Garden) to brand spanking new, at least when construction of new arenas is complete in Sacramento, San Francisco (Golden State) and Milwaukee. Sponsorships are up, both plentiful and bountiful, and the league has been exploring new revenue streams such as daily fantasy and uniform advertisements. Silver on Media DealsNBA Commissioner Adam Silver discusses what the new NBA media deals mean for the longterm health of the league. The NBA is said to , players and fans interacting in ways that didn't exist a few years ago. As for the game itself, the Golden State Warriors are as breezy, likeable and fresh a champion as many people can remember, a roster built in traditional fashion playing a non-traditional style of basketball. In pace, in lineup configurations and in their deployment of the 3-point shot, the Warriors at least temporarily have transformed not just the league but the sport.  The international appeal continues unabated. More than 100 players from 37 nations held roster spots when the 2015-16 season opened. This All-Star Weekend will be broadcast to 215 countries in 49 languages, with 336 credentialed media outlets from around the planet. Even a dreaded taxi strike in Toronto set for this weekend was called off in time to serve the NBA's agenda.  So what could go wrong? Could there really be dark clouds gathering in the short-, mid- or long-term forecasts?  The answer, of course, is yes.   Devotees of the Hack-A-______ strategy probably . Silver told  last week that he is \"increasingly of the view that we will be looking to make some sort of change in that rule this summer.\"  The tactic in which a notoriously poor free-throw shooter -- most often the Los Angeles Clippers' , Detroit Pistons'  or Houston Rockets' , with the Golden State Warriors'  and Memphis Grizzlies'  mixed in as non-centers -- is intentionally fouled away from the play is the NBA's topic du jour. Traditionalists feel, rather than legislating a rule change, that the burden ought to be on those guys to thwart the maneuver. As longtime big man Nazr Mohammed : \"To let poor free-throw shooters like myself off the hook is not the message we should be sending.\"  But others are more pragmatic, and when that includes the commissioner, it seems likely the league's competition committee will be charged with finding a fix. The Starters: Hack-A-RulesAdam Silver said the NBA will look at the current 'Hack-A-Shaq' rule \u2014 should it be changed? \"As I travel around the league, there's that one school of thought 'Guys have got to make their free throws,' \" Silver said. \"But then at the end of the day, we are an entertainment property. And it's clear that when you're in the arena, that fans are looking at me, shrugging their shoulders with that look saying, 'Aren't you going to do something about this?' \"  Said TNT's Chris Webber: \"That's going to be a real discussion. Do you change the rules for eight guys, 10 guys, none of whom are really the stars of this league, because they can't shoot free throws? When I can show you kids in the seventh grade who can make 80 percent of their free throws? So I think we're gonna have to talk about how those decisions are going to affect the overall game. Do we want to bore fans to death? Do we want players to get better? I really want to see where we go with that. Hopefully not with major rule changes but something's going to have to be done.\"  The NBA, in what now is two full years of Silver's appointment, has been quick to respond in matters of player, referee and fan safety -- thinning and moving the crowd of cameras along the baselines, for instance -- so there's no reason to think it won't move swiftly to address the exploitation of a rule.  As , president of the National Basketball Players Association, told NBA.com shortly after his arrival to All-Star Weekend Thursday: \"There's always the game. But even me, I had to realize, it also is entertainment. Our fans, we're always trying to get feedback from them.\" Do we want to bore fans to death? Do we want players to get better? I really want to see where we go with that. Hopefully not with major rule changes but something's going to have to be done.\u2013 TNT analyst Chris Webber There are other basketball-related topics in play, from the proposed 1-through-16 seeding of playoff teams without regard for conference to tweaks to the Draft lottery. A pet one here is the over-utilization of the 3-point shot and the sameness it has produced in teams' attacks. Style and math are dictating personnel more than the other way around. Even coaches whose rosters have competent, potentially superior big men are cowed into trying to keep up by scoring by threes.  How about widening the floor to make the 3-point line a true arc and lose the convenient corner locations? Maybe extend the line a bit to increase the difficult -- well, for most guys not named ? Some of the game's greatest athletic artistry came in that \"long two\" area now pooh-poohed by the analytics set. Making the 3-pointer less an Everyman's shot might bring some of that back.   Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and out-of-the-box thinker, had a swift response when asked about a big challenge facing the NBA. \"Simple,\" Cuban wrote in an email. \"Growing our TV audience.\"  Contractually, that might not seem like a pressing matter, with the new ESPN/TNT deal -- taking annual payments of about $930 million to an average of $2.66 billion -- locked and loaded. Then again, the deal has to be a good one for the TV partners too or the next time around, the numbers might head down.  So many other opportunities available to the NBA only get enhanced if the TV audience gets bigger. And both the technology and the audience is changing, with more consumers \"cutting the cord\" in pursuit of more personalized, a la carte TV programming options.  Any discussion of the NBA's future is packed with pachyderms -- that is, the elephant in every room, represented by the prospect that either the owners or the players will opt out of  before its full term. Invoking that option by Dec. 15, 2016 will end the CBA as of July 1, 2017, which means another series of contract talks is just around the corner. Another lockout could hit in less than 17 months and, reminiscent of the ones in 1998 and 2011, real games and real money could be lost to start the 2017-18 season.  Keep in mind, the salary cap already has been projected to hit $108 million per team by then, up from its current $70 million and another big leap from the $89 million penciled in for next season.  For a sense of just how much money will be in play, it's worth recalling the rancor players felt four years ago after their 57 percent share of basketball-related revenue (BRI) had been negotiated down to 49-to-51 percent, a huge concession to the owners' claims that most teams were losing money. The subsequent cap in 2011-12 (in 2015 dollars) was $61 million. The whole thing that went on with the last negotiation process was the owners were telling us they were losing money. There's no way they can sit in front of us and tell us that right now.\u2013 Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James Well, the $70 million salary cap already in use this season is the equivalent of 57.4 percent of BRI in 2011-12 -- which means the players already are ahead, in sheer dollars, of where they were before the last lockout. At an $89 million cap, that's like getting 73 percent of BRI from just five seasons back. And a $108 million cap figure represents an 88 percent share of the previous total pot.  The players understand how robust the business is these days, with many determined to win back BRI share almost as a statement or source of pride distinct from absolute dollars. They know the Clippers sold to Steve Ballmer for $2 million, that the Knicks are estimated to be worth $3 billion and that almost every owner is turning a profit. The union reportedly is considering taking back the group licensing/marketing rights it traditionally has sold off to the league for about $40 million, believing it can do better while exercising control.  As Cleveland's , an NBPA first vice-president, said: \"The whole thing that went on with the last negotiation process was the owners were telling us they were losing money. There's no way they can sit in front of us and tell us that right now.\"  Ownership will contend that the financial stability generated by the current CBA is a big reason why the league is attractive to investors and sponsors.   Here's another money-related challenge that could impact the next round of CBA talks and even the league's general sense of well-being, as suggested by TNT's Reggie Miller. The flood of TV money over the next two years, bloating cap space for a limited supply of players (teams are obliged to spend 90 percent of the cap amount each season), will lead to some contract mistakes.  So while Miller doesn't predict another lockout, he does anticipate some discord.  \"My only problem would be what I call the \"Jon Koncak Rule.\" When guys with [ordinary] numbers get rewarded with huge contracts,\" the former Indiana Pacers shooting guard said.  Koncak was the Atlanta Hawks center who, because he hit free agency at just the right time in 1989, landed a (gasp!) six-year, $13.1 million deal that rankled some NBA rivals. A 7-footer from SMU, Koncak had averaged 4.7 points, 6.1 rebounds and 20.7 minutes prior to signing what then was a massive contract.  \"That could be a problem, because I see guys who have OK numbers that are in line to get $18 million or $22 million,\" Miller said, updating to current price tags. \"I see that being a problem because some superstar is going to be like, 'Wait a minute! Are you kidding me? If he's getting $18 [million], then I'm worth $35 [million].' \"  One team's decision to overpay a player can warp the market for every other player who thinks he is better and for every other team, regardless if it wants to pursue fiscal responsibility. The likelihood of it happening increased, allegedly, when the NBPA declined the NBA's suggestion of \"smoothing\" in the new TV money over several years, rather than dumping it into the system immediately.  The league still would have paid out 51 percent of BRI but less initially would have gone into the salary cap, with more paid in a lump sum to be distributed by the union (typically on a pro-rated basis). But rather than structure the ESPN/TNT payments to do more of the \"smoothing\" for them, the owners wanted more of the money sooner. Kind of like the players.  All of this will get hashed out in the CBA talks. Some preliminary discussions already have taken place, with Silver and Roberts meeting quietly to find common ground and, perhaps, get out front of grittier, more heavily covered formal negotiations.  Some wonder if Roberts, in handling her first contract talks as the union's executive director in place of deposed Billy Hunter, might want to demonstrate toughness, which could make a compromise difficult. Others, though, believe she will show her competency by being smart, if a good deal can avoid lost games.  Silver, at a time when so much is going so well, surely isn't eager to gash open the start of the 2017-18 season either. Ultimately that particular challenge will come down to two parties that previously shared a large pizza figuring out how to divvy up an XXL pizza. With so much more on the table, do they really want to fight over the last piece?  The answer will have to wait. But when an enterprise's biggest challenge comes from having so much, as opposed to too little, business generally is good. Awfully good.      "},

{"url": "http://www.nba.com/2016/news/features/shaun_powell/02/12/kobe-prepares-for-last-all-star-dance/index.html", "text": "  \u2014 So this is where the All-Star trail ends, here in a place that's currently colder than his stare, in a foreign country that wouldn't be his first choice (he was partially raised in Italy) and where he has absolutely positively no meaningful basketball moments.  \"I think me and  went at it a few times,\"  said, trying to shake a fuzzy memory.  Perhaps. Nobody thinks of Kobe and Toronto in any great historical context and if anything, he ranks behind Carter in terms of direct influence on this generation of Canadian youth basketball. It's true that his epic 81-point game was unleashed on the hometown Raptors, although that was enjoyed by the spoiled fans in Los Angeles. That said, this very underrated basketball town will suit Kobe's All-Star farewell just fine, because how could it not?  \"This is his weekend,\" said  of the Knicks and East Stars. \"It's his last hurrah.\"  Really, it wouldn't matter where Sunday's game is played. The basketball universe is one big country without a border, and a player like Kobe is internationally known anyway. When he took a seat in the interview chair Friday, surrounded by more cameras than any Kardashian sister sees, he spoke to a group of journalists that was 50 percent American, 50 percent from elsewhere. Not many players get that diverse of an audience, and few can connect as well; as he often does in these settings, Kobe entertained questions in English and Spanish.  \"This is pretty cool,\" he said, surveying the scene. \"I'm looking around the room and see guys that are tearing the league up who were like four when my first All-Star Game came along. How many players can say they played 20 years and have seen the game go through a few generations? It's not a sad moment for me. I'm really happy and honored to be here and playing on this team and in this city.\"  As much as they've spent their time apart, Kobe and Toronto basketball grew up together. Toronto was awarded a franchise in 1995 and Bryant was drafted straight from high school a year later. In that sense, Toronto has a firmer connection with Kobe than, say, Michael Jordan, who only had a half-dozen peak years left. The locals only got to enjoy Kobe for the Lakers' once-a-season visit, and of course they never met in the NBA Finals, and so the admiration of Kobe was mainly from afar.  This isn't the Kobe they, or us, once knew. By his own admission, the retiring 20-year veteran is \"old as hell,\" he said, laughing. Although that part has been long forgiven and totally understood. The basketball public spoke and voted him as an All-Star starter anyway, and nobody objected, not even fellow players who probably lost a spot on the team because of Kobe. His legacy has meant that much to this generation. His body, an old 37, has aggressively waved the white flag, making this the only time that any part of Kobe has given up. Therefore, what you'll see on Sunday is a   \"I'll be good with 10,\" he said, when asked how much playing time he'd like.  All-Star moments are rarely crystalized and preserved in our memory banks, mainly because the game itself is a simple exhibition. You've seen one, you've pretty much seen them all. Some are exceptions: Magic Johnson in 1992 after his HIV announcement being the most pronounced.  Kobe's first All-Star Game might be No. 2 on the unforgettable list. It was the Passing the Torch game, meaningful for that and other reasons. Kobe was just 19, the youngest All-Star ever. The setting was New York and the arena was the Garden. It was 1998 and Jordan was making his final appearance as a Bull (though no one knew for sure at the time). With Jordan on the East (coached by Larry Bird no less) and Kobe on the West, the square-off was just too irresistible to ignore, and the pair fed everyone's appetite by trading baskets.  In a sense, that scene will be repeated Sunday because Kobe will have so many torches in his hands, he might burn his fingers. There is Steph Curry and ,  and ,  and others who were raised on basketball by Kobe. Kobe Gives LeBron His Game ShoesKobe Bryant signs his game-worn shoes for LeBron James following Kobe's final game in Cleveland. \"I think we owe a lot to him,\" said LeBron. \"He inspired a lot of people in this generation and the best way to honor him is to inspire others in return, and that's what I've tried to do.\"  Westbrook is an LA kid and therefore worshipped Kobe, and said: \"I used to try and copy his moves, and definitely learn how to prepare myself and play hard and bring a competitive spirit the way he did.\"  In his first game against Kobe, Westbrook was thrilled, not just because he finally had the chance to be on the same court with his basketball idol. \"I was a little nervous but I didn't have to guard him,\" Westbrook said, laughing. \"I had Derek Fisher. And I never switched off.\"  Most of Kobe's fellow Stars treasure not only the games against him, but his advice and his time, which he willingly gives. Kobe gave his cell number to , who was a rookie then, and Wall just stared at it.  \"Couldn't believe it,\" Wall said. \"But that's the kind of great player he is. He just wants to put you in the right position to get better as a basketball player.\"  Let Kobe explain why:  \"We all have dreams, and when you go through the process, you sometimes hit roadblocks. You might give up on dreams and lose the imagination. I had roadblocks but I never gave up on it.\" Kobe Bryant's All-Star MixtapeTake a look back at Kobe Bryant's greatest highlights from his 17 All-Star games. No, he didn't crumble from some early playoff setbacks, from losing Shaquille O'Neal, from playing alongside Smush Parker, from losing a pair of NBA Finals that he'd like to have back. After 19-plus years and three surgeries of late, Kobe is an All-Star once again and isn't taking it for granted.  \"When you're young, you never think you're going to get old,\" he said. \"You never think you're going to be hurt, that your body's going to give out. Time has a funny way of doing that. It humbles you, brings you down to Earth. Gravity.\"  Kobe will surely receive the kind of applause on Sunday that Canada usually reserves for hockey greats. Toronto has a young franchise but knows basketball. Kobe taught it well.      "},

He stepped closer to the  by being  from the North American committee on Friday afternoon, moving a final election away from a trip to Springfield, Mass., in September, an enshrinement ceremony and an acceptance speech. A worrisome, frightening acceptance speech.  \"I'm scared of that process because I know how emotional I am and how I feel about the people that I love and that love me,\" Iverson said. \"So I have no idea (what I'll say).\"  He will have to summarize the kind of basketball life that could never have been scripted, a hero and a villain, one of the stars of his generation and unable to find work by the end full of indignity, someone who has soared and endured, and no one understands that more than AI himself. He gets what this all means.  Reaching the Hall, if he receives at least 18 of 24 votes in the last hurdle to election, would be the culmination of a long, strange, glorious, difficult ride. It's like it was all too much to consider Friday, so he couldn't go there, and meanwhile not wanting to talk about it said plenty. 2016 Hall Of Fame ClassNBA TV's Rick Kamla introduces the NBA's Hall of Fame class of 2016. He would be Allen Iverson to the very end of his journey as a player, as real and unapologetic as ever, wearing tattered jeans, a Reebok T-shirt, a Yankees cap, Reebok mids and a fistful of chains around his neck to the announcement at a downtown hotel that is usually business casual at the least. And the emotions. Of course the emotions. That's so AI as well.  \"Is it emotional?\" he said, repeating the question. \"Yeah. I ain't gonna give it to ya'll, you know what I'm saying. I get too emotional at times about things, especially when it comes to my family and my friends and my fans, so I ain't giving ya'll that one.\"  Meaning he wanted to keep most of his feelings private.  \"It made me feel good about the people that helped me along the journey,\" Iverson said. \"It made me feel good about them because I couldn't have done this by myself. I'm just so happy and gracious that the people that helped me get to this point rocked with me.\"  That will be some show of it all comes rushing out in the Sept. 9 acceptance speech in Springfield. Think about how famously . Now multiply that by a couple hundred.  \"I think he's brushing it off a little bit,\" Iverson's friend Nate Archibald, a 1991 inductee, said of the initial reaction.  Brushing it off?  \"I think it's because when it happens then you can believe that it happened,\" Archibald said. \"If you're asking me 'Could it happen?' -- c'mon, man. There's three guys to me, and I'm not part of the (voting) committee, that if they're not in then I will have a heart attack. That's Shaq, Yao Ming, Allen Iverson. You play it down a little bit. But you can hear it in his speech now. It's like, 'Trying to think of certain things that I have to say' and stuff like that, which is different for a guy who's confident and is used to being around public speaking. He's like, 'I'm not giving up anything because I don't really know.' \" I'm scared of that process because I know how emotional I am and how I feel about the people that I love and that love me.\u2013 Allen Iverson on possible acceptance speech Shaquille O'Neal obviously made it through the first of two rounds of voting en route to certain first-ballot election, while Kevin Johnson, former referee Darell Garretson, current and former college coaches Lefty Driesell, Tom Izzo, John McLendon, Bo Ryan and Eddie Sutton, and former high school coach Robert Hughes also reached the finalist stage. Shaq and Iverson both on the Symphony Hall stage in slightly less than seven months could be unmatched theater.  Tim Hardaway, meanwhile, did not advance, a setback after making it to finalist a year ago.

The Daily News of New York reported Friday that the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics had discussed a deal involving  and that there were \"very preliminary discussions\" with the Knicks about expanding it to include Anthony, who would end up with  in Cleveland.  But Anthony, who has to agree to any deal, told SiriusXM NBA Radio that he's \"not going nowhere.\"  During his interviews after practice for the All-Star Game, Anthony added that he's had no conversations with the Knicks or anyone else about leaving the team.  \"I don't know where it comes from so sometimes it gets to you as a player. Just get tired of hearing something all the time,\" Anthony said. \"I'm not on the run. I could've ran somewhere when I was a free agent, you know what I'm saying? I came back for a reason. I came back because I wanted to do this.\"  Anthony was acquired by the Knicks five years ago and in July 2014 signed a five-year deal to stay with them. He was granted the right to veto any trade, which few players have, when he re-signed.  He bypassed the chance to join contenders such as Chicago or Houston, and prefers to chase a championship in New York even though the Knicks remain nowhere close.  \"Doing it in New York is better than doing it any place in the world,\" Anthony said. \"One in New York is better than multiple somewhere else, so that was the reason I wanted to come to New York. That's the reason why I'm in New York, so it just bothers me when I started hearing all these trade rumors and trade talks.\"  James wasn't concerned about the report.  \"It's false. That's the way I look at it and see it,\" he said. \"It's false. It's the last thing I was trying to worry about right now is trade talks.\"  Anthony found out about the report when a friend back home in Baltimore texted him while he was watching teammate  play in the Rising Stars Challenge. Anthony said he simply put the phone back in his pocket.  Knicks President of Basketball Operations Phil Jackson noted Anthony's no-trade clause last week when talking about the team's plans for Thursday's trade deadline. But with the Knicks' struggles and Anthony's high salary and continued knee pain at age 31, speculation about his future will continue.  \"Eventually you get tired of hearing it,\" Anthony said. "},

One win down at All-Star weekend. One to go.  LaVine had 30 points and seven rebounds and the United States team beat the World team 157-154 in the Rising Stars Challenge on Friday night to kick off the weekend festivities.  In the game featuring some of the best rookies and sophomores in the league, LaVine geared up to defend his slam dunk title on Saturday night by making 13 of 20 shots to beat Wiggins, who took home MVP honors last year in Brooklyn.  \"I'm excited for tomorrow,\" said LaVine, who revived interest in the dunk contest with an electrifying performance last year. \"I'm ready to put on a show.\" Best of Phantom: Rising Stars ChallengeRe-live the exciting 2016 BBVA Rising Stars Challenge through the slow-motion lens of the phantom cam.  scored 30 points, and  had 30 points and 10 assists for the World team. Wiggins scored 29 points while playing in front of his hometown fans.  Los Angeles Lakers sophomore  added 25 for the Americans.  The Rising Stars game can sometimes take on the feel of a sideshow, something that forces the next generation into a spotlight that they aren't always ready for. But the court was loaded with talent on Friday night in Toronto, players like Wiggins, Porzingis, Karl-Anthony Towns,  and .  The influx of talent has given several long-suffering franchises - the Timberwolves, Knicks, Bucks - hope that better days are arriving soon.  For most fans in attendance, Wiggins was the star attraction. He has been churning out highlight reels since he was 14 years old, was drafted No. 1 overall last season and won the rookie of the year award. The locals have called him \"Maple Jordan\" and openly pine for him to one day come home and play for the Raptors.  \"It felt great,\" Wiggins said. \"I got to play in front of a lot of people I haven't seen in a long time. My family, friends got to watch it. It was great being back home and playing in front of my hometown.\"  Wiggins has stated time and again that he loves it in Minnesota and envisions a long and bright future with Towns, LaVine and the rest of the Timberwolves' promising young core. But he has never shied away from his love of Toronto and he said he was looking forward to being back in Canada for an extended stretch this weekend while the rest of the basketball world finally trained its focus on his hometown. Best of Phantom: Zach LaVineWatch the high-flying dunks from Zach LaVine's performance in the 2016 BBVA Rising Stars Challenge through the slow-motion phantom cam. Wiggins received a thunderous ovation upon introduction in the starting lineup and was serenaded with chants of \"M-V-P! M-V-P!\" late in the game.  \"He's a rock star in his hometown,\" LaVine said.  For as much time as the 20-year-old Wiggins has spent in the spotlight in his young life, he is remarkably disinterested in attention. He threw down a few big dunks early in the game - one off of a backboard pass from Mudiay - to get the crowd on its feet, but was also happy to let his teammates get in on the action until a late flurry that got the World team back in it.  Porzingis, the Latvian who captivated the Big Apple and helped revive the Knicks, hit 5 of 8 3-pointers and threw down an alley-oop midway through the second half. And Mudiay, the Nuggets rookie who has struggled with his shot this season, hit 5 of 10 from deep.  Phoenix Suns rookie  scored 23 points, while D'Angelo Russell added 22 and Towns 18 for the U.S. team.  And Wiggins wasn't mad at all that LaVine walked out of the arena with the MVP trophy.  \"I got it last year, he got it this year,\" Wiggins said. \"(Towns) is going to get it next year. We're going back-to-back-to-back. That's the plan.\"  "},

He has conferred regularly with Heat medical officials about the issue, which he has been dealing with and getting treatment for over the past several days. Bosh came to Toronto with hopes of participating in Saturday's 3-point contest and Sunday's , but dropped out Friday out of concern of making the calf worse.  \"It just lingered and I didn't feel it was wise to continue to push it, especially with this elongated week that we have off,\" Bosh said. \"I just wanted to make sure that I was taking the necessary precautions and being a good professional.\"  Bosh leads the Heat in scoring this season, averaging 19.1 points per game. Miami next plays in Atlanta on Friday, and Bosh's status for that game almost certainly won't be determined until the additional tests are performed.  \"I'm pretty optimistic,\" Bosh said.  His 2014-15 season ended over the All-Star break as well, after a blood clot was found on one of his lungs - the scary irony for the Heat there being that Bosh believes that clot formed after he was kicked in the calf, then broke off and traveled to his lung to create a career- and life-threatening situation.  \"When we get back to Miami we'll do everything we need to do to make sure it's right,\" Bosh said.  Wade said he advised Bosh last season that his health and the future of his family were bigger than basketball, and repeated that refrain again Saturday.  \"I'm trying not to think about it too far,\" Wade said. \"I just know the basics. I don't know too much. Anytime I'm around him, I'm like `Let's talk about this weekend. Let's not think about the season or anything right now.'

Just 1 1/2 seasons later, Jackson decided he needed someone else.  Fisher was fired Monday, with his team having lost five straight and nine of 10 to fall well back in the Eastern Conference playoff race.  \"It's time for us to make a change, turn this team around and move forward and get some wins and keep going down the road we had started here at the beginning of the year,\" Jackson said at the team's practice facility.  Associate head coach Kurt Rambis was promoted to interim head coach at least through the rest of the season. Rambis, like Fisher an ex-Laker player and a former assistant under Jackson, went 56-145 in two seasons as Minnesota's coach.  The Knicks have fallen to 23-31, dropping Fisher's overall record to 40-96. Jackson hired Fisher in June 2014, just weeks after Fisher was done playing.  \"It's a huge transition from being a player to a coach at any point in time, let alone the season after you retire from playing. So it was a very difficult situation, regardless of where he coached,\" Rambis said.  \"This is a historic franchise and this is a franchise and a fan base that's used to winning and he started the process, and it won't be finished and it may not be finished with the next two coaches that are coming in, but I think he was laying the foundation of doing things the right way and turning this franchise around.\"  But Fisher wasn't winning lately, and though Jackson praised his work ethic, he had seen enough of the Knicks' slow starts and faulty finishes.  Jackson also questioned whether Fisher took advantage of the experienced assistants Jackson hired to work with him, such as Rambis and Jim Cleamons. Jackson, who won an NBA-record 11 championships as a coach, also told Fisher he may not have mentored him as well as he could have.  \"There wasn't really a consensus in our staff. We decided we need to have really good consensus in the working staff, interchanging of ideas and communication,\" Jackson said.  The Knicks went 17-65 last season but upgraded their roster during the summer with the drafting of  and the signing of veterans  and .  Fisher then got off to an embarrassing start this season during training camp. He was involved in a fight with Memphis Grizzlies forward and former teammate  when he was at the home of Barnes' estranged wife in California.  \"No one's happy about how that happened and what came out of that,\" Jackson said. \"That was embarrassing for us and for Derek, but that had no nothing to do with what's happened here today.\"  , a teammate of Fisher when the Lakers were winning a bunch of NBA titles, said being let go \"is part of the job.  \"He'll go on to be a coach again,\" Bryant said before Monday night's game at Indiana. \"I know he likes teaching the game. I know he likes being around the game, so I'm sure he'll be coaching again.\"  The Knicks had the look of a playoff team most of the season but are stumbling into the All-Star break. Fans loudly booed when they fell behind by 19 points Sunday during a 101-96 loss to Denver.  Fisher became the fifth coach to be fired this season and the second in New York. Brooklyn had already dumped Lionel Hollins.  \"This is a very talented team with strong character and I am confident they will succeed,\" Fisher said in a statement. \"Obviously, I'm disappointed, but have learned an immense amount from this experience and hope to grow from it.\"  Fisher was a five-time champion playing under Jackson with the Lakers and known as one of the league's smartest players. Jackson turned to him after Steve Kerr chose to take the Golden State Warriors' job after he was on the verge of accepting the Knicks' offer.  Former head coaches Tom Thibodeau, Mark Jackson and Brian Shaw all are available. Or Jackson could wait and perhaps make at a run at another of his former players -- Luke Walton, who led Golden State to the best start in NBA history while Kerr was recovering from back surgery.  But he said he was not looking at any coaching candidates now, saying he was fully confident in Rambis.  \"Someone has to match the style of the way we do things and there's a certain style that I have that I think works and I've found worked before,\" Jackson said. \"I don't know if all those people measure up to that, because I don't know them well enough, but that's an important aspect and we'll find that type of person.\"  Fisher had overseen the worst season in franchise history as a rookie coach and recently said making the playoffs this season wasn't as important as the franchise's progress. Jackson hasn't said if he expected or demanded a postseason berth, but Rambis said it should be the goal for fans and free agents.  \"So we've got to figure out a way to right this ship so that we can make a push to get into the playoffs,\" Rambis said.

He had been asked, rather innocently, how he had spent his time after his New England Patriots won their third Super Bowl in four seasons. It was March. The sun was warm and inviting over the Hawaiian Islands; the ocean blue and calm. And, still, Belichick's mask stayed firm and tight, as he managed to smirk and grin at the same time. There would be no reminiscing.  \"What Super Bowl?\" he said. \"We're two months into the offseason. Nobody cares about the Super Bowl.\"  You can't dismiss his attitude. Belichick has now won four Super Bowls, and been in six as coach of the Patriots, one of the NFL's true dynasties. The way he has approached his job -- with unsparing lack of sentimentality, never looking back, never being satisfied -- has worked for him and his team.  It is not the way Steve Kerr approaches life.  It doesn't make Kerr right and Belichick wrong. It just makes them different. Belichick would no doubt recoil at the idea of celebrating what happened last season during the following season. To Kerr, such rigidity is unfathomable. The Warriors Visit the White HouseAn all-access look as the Golden State Warriors celebrate their NBA title with a visit to the White House. Which is why, after laying the wood to the Washington Wizards the night before, the Warriors went to the White House Thursday, watched President Barack Obama impersonate 's jump-in-place jig, and celebrated their 2014-15 title in the East Room along with 75 friends and family members, and two former teammates:  and , now in Boston and Atlanta, respectively.  Forget their title? Are you nuts?  \"I think that stuff is overplayed,\" Kerr said afterward, standing outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \"It doesn't really make any difference. We're obviously doing really well, and our guys are competitive and focused. We're just playing. Everything's loose around here. We don't worry too much about semantics, or whatever. We got to visit the White House.\" President Obama Receives Warriors JerseyWarriors coach Steve Kerr presents President Obama with a personalized Golden State jersey. Now, let's get real. , having yet to lose a game at Oracle Arena after pushing back another challenger in the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night, and posing the first real challenge to the Bulls' all-time single season record of 72-10, Kerr might not be as sanguine. But, they are. So, he is. And, look: it's his nature. Ever curious about the world, and quick with a joke, Kerr usually moves toward the bright side of life. The Warriors work hard, but play hard and laugh hard, too.  Kerr has his team living in the moment, the way coach Phil Jackson insisted the Bulls did when Kerr played with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the journey more important than the result. They are ever-present for whatever they're doing -- physically, mentally and emotionally.  It's part of why the Warriors were able to play so well while Kerr recovered from two back surgeries that cost him the first two months of the season, why they were so sharp for interim coach Luke Walton in winning their first 24 games of the season. They aren't suffocated by challenges. They're inspired by them. President Obama: Curry Clownin'President Obama describes Steph Curry's 51-point performance against the Wizards. Don't get it twisted: Kerr is a competitive SOB who burns to win, and he still goes crazy when the Warriors are so, so loose with the ball. A clipboard died a hero in New York last week after facing Kerr's wrath. But he lets his players indulge their crazy.  \"We're less of a team,\" assistant coach Ron Adams says, \"and more of a fraternity.\"  But they're a frat without the drunken toga parties.  The Warriors' rush chairman remains the amiable and accessible Curry, who was , after getting cut by the long nails of the Knicks'  in New York.  \"Light-skinned problems,\" Curry said; such is his cache that he can even joke about his complexion -- the difference in supposed favor between light-skinned and dark-skinned African-Americans has historically been a third rail issue among many black folk -- and everybody laughs. Thunder vs. WarriorsStephen Curry scored 26 points,and the Warriors beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 116-108 on Saturday night. Well on his way to back-to-back league MVP honors, Curry's performance in D.C. last Wednesday -- 51 points, , on seven 3-pointers -- was the latest display of how, incredibly, Curry could and should get consideration for Kia Most Improved Player Award honors as well this season. His handle is immaculate, his range infinite, his control of almost every game firm.  On another team, 's stroke and/or 's all-around game would be catalysts around which teams would try to build contenders. Both are that good. But it's Curry that stretches the geometry of basketball, taking the game places it's never been -- the ultimate intersection of the game's emphasis on offense, and his incredible skill set. It's not a stretch to say no one has ever possessed such a set. I think we play the game the right way. We respect the game. It's kind of like -- I wouldn't say a traveling circus, a traveling show. It's a lot of different fans. We've made a lot of believers.\u2013 Golden State Warriors guard Shaun Livingston I asked  how the Warriors could possibly be better this season than last year, when they went 67-15. \"You know why,\" he said.  The drive that pushed Jordan's greatness, night after night -- he always said there was someone in the arena that may have never seen him play, and he didn't want to disappoint -- is present in Curry. He was going to spend Super Bowl Sunday at the Super Bowl in Santa Clara, Calif., rooting on his close friend Cam Newton and Curry's hometown Carolina Panthers. It was killing him not to be able to do anything but watch.  \"I hate (being a fan), actually,\" Curry said. \"I get nervous and jittery. When you're watching a game, obviously I have no control. It's tough. I enjoy the fan in me watching what they do and the success they're having, but I get into it. It's a different experience.\" Curry and Wall Duel in D.C.Check out the battle between Warriors reigning MVP Stephen Curry and Wizards All-Star John Wall in D.C. on Wednesday night. He left Newton alone last week -- no encouraging texts or calls.  \"Having been in a similar situation six months ago, you kind of understand how much is going on,\" Curry said. \"I don't know what Super Bowls are like, but you get asked the same questions over and over again, and you're obviously all the while trying to prepare to win a Super Bowl. So I just leave him alone.\"  The Warriors, of course, , and it feels like that was the last time Golden State really played in a hostile environment. At almost every venue this season, Warriors fans come out in huge numbers and take over opposing arenas. It's about not so much wins and losses, but what level can we reach? Because we need to if we're going to reach our ultimate goal, to play at that level consistently. Otherwise we'll suffer a tough fate in the playoffs.\u2013 Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr \"It's just like a movie,\" forward  said. \"It's just like a dream when you're out there. But, it's reality.\"  Every team that wins a title gets more fans as an ancillary benefit. But the crowds rooting for the Warriors on the road are ridiculous.  Jordan's Bulls were loved by millions, but there was also a hint of danger with them when they came to town -- like if you didn't capitulate, they could plunder the town, steal your girlfriends and take all the choice parking spots. That's not the case with the Warriors. Opposing fans seem to almost wish for a beatdown, if it means they can watch Curry drop three or four seemingly impossible shots, or watch the Warriors' tic-tac-toe passing end in a layup or a Thompson shot on the weakside.  And afterward, there's Kerr to tell them what they need to do better. It's no slight on Walton, who did a great job. But Kerr has some edge to him, and his team will need it down the road.  \"It's huge,\" Thompson said. \"Believe it or not, things go by really fast, and before we know it, we'll be on our last leg (of the season). We have to be as sharp as possible. Steve, even when we win games, he's harping on the little things that we can do better, like ball control, and having stingy defense. It's huge to have him back. We were a great team without him, but it's even scarier with him, how good we can be.\" Warriors vs. WizardsStephen Curry scores 51 points, including 11 3-pointers as the Warriors beat the Wizards, 134-121. Said guard : \"We have a very likeable team, all the way down to our coach. Obviously, a lot of people are fans of his as well. I think we play the game the right way. We respect the game. It's kind of like -- I wouldn't say a traveling circus, a traveling show. It's a lot of different fans. We've made a lot of believers. A couple of games it was like, are we in Oracle? Are we in the Bay right now?\"  Thursday they were in D.C., with bipartisan politicos (former House Speaker and Democrat Nancy Pelosi; House Majority Leader and Republican Kevin McCarthy) trying to get a reflected piece of their glory. After a tour of the Oval Office, it was off to the East Room, where Obama opined that Thompson's jumper might be a little purer than Curry's, disclosed that Barnes is known as \"The Senator\" by teammates, meaning someone dropped a dime on Barnes during the tour (\"I think it was Coach Kerr,\" Barnes said afterward) and told Green that while he loves his game, Green needs to watch the cussing and technical fouls.  \"I've been doing good lately,\" Green said.  Only Kerr, Walton (who won back-to-back titles with the Lakers) and Curry (who'd visited Obama last year in D.C. as part of his work raising funds for the Nothing But Nets anti-malaria initiative), had previous White House experience.  \"I told President Clinton, the third time, 'we've got to stop meeting like this,' \" Kerr said. \"He had no idea what I was talking about.\"  The Warriors have actually regressed -- slightly -- defensively this season,  to . And they're allowing almost three points a game more this season than last. But it doesn't matter much because of how lethal the Warriors' offense has become. Inside The NBA: Warriors' White House VisitShaq, Kenny and Chuck re-visit President Obama's visit with the champion Warriors. Tops in the league last season at 110 points per game, the Warriors are somehow . (Their average margin of victory --  -- would be the biggest in league history if not for the fact that .)  Kerr said before the season that he thought the Warriors could be even better.  \"I think just the championship teams that I've been on, when you win one, there's a much deeper level of confidence after the fact,\" he said. \"There's also, I think, a little bit of a burden that's lifted. Our guys never have to worry about people saying 'yeah, but.' We've already won one. A little bit of playing with house money. We should be loose, we should have fun.  \"So the combination just of the extra confidence, the continuity that comes from being together for a while, that burden being lifted, I think that all means we should be out here having fun and doing exactly what we're doing.\"  Their passing makes loading up one side of the floor useless. The ball never sticks when it goes from the strong side to the weak side as whoever gets it sends it on its way within moments.  If Green has it, he drives the paint if the defender closes, often finding whatever big is on the floor, either  or , for a lob dunk. If the Warriors are playing their \"Lineup of Death\" with Green at the five, he looks for baseline cutters. If that's cut off, it's back to screen and roll with Curry, with Thompson always available for yet another crosscourt look. Through Sunday, via NBA.com/Stats,  (62.4) and  (17.8).  We're obviously doing really well, and our guys are competitive and focused. We're just playing. Everything's loose around here. We don't worry too much about semantics, or whatever.\u2013 Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr And the Splash Brothers' green light is on all the time.  \"Most of the time, guys like Steph and Klay that freelance all the time on the plays, (Kerr) don't really get mad at that,\" Speights said. \"Other guys, he might say something to them, 'cause it's been our rule. So you just go out and play and find open guys for a pin down, or just keep the ball moving, and he's okay with it.\"  The bench is no easier, with Iguodala and  hunting runouts. Iguodala is shooting 49.8 percent, his highest percentage since his second season in the league (2005-06). Barbosa, per NBA.com, is fifth in the league in percentage of shots taken in the first six seconds of the shot clock (24.9). And the 6-foot-7 Livingston is locked in, his confidence in his game and body the highest it's been in years, able to post up just about every guard that tries to check him.  \"I just think last year, playing all the way into The Finals, winning a championship, having a role defined, first time I've been on the same team for multiple years,\" Livingston said. \"It has a lot to do with just settling in, having a role here, an identity, and just confidence, trusting my game and the work I've put in.\"  At some point, the Warriors will have to address the elephant in the room. With 32 games left, they have to go 27-5 to break Chicago's record. Who, now, doesn't think that's more than possible -- even with three games left against San Antonio and two with Oklahoma City?  And who thinks it isn't possible, with a coach who laughs loud and was smiling down the stretch of Saturday's tight game with the Thunder (\"it's about time we were in a close game,\" he said to his team during a timeout), but who is still pushing for perfection.  \"I'm very laid back,\" Kerr said. \"We're very loose and we have a lot of fun. So every once in a while if I snap and break a clipboard, I think the guys respond to it. If I did it every day, they would get sick of it. I think they all understand it is about reaching a standard that we've set. It's about not so much wins and losses, but what level can we reach? Because we need to if we're going to reach our ultimate goal, to play at that level consistently. Otherwise we'll suffer a tough fate in the playoffs.\"      Forty-one straight wins at Oracle after holding off the Thunder Saturday. That is the equivalent of a full season's worth of home games. Inside Access: Thunder - WarriorsIn a matchup of two of the top teams in the NBA and the past two league MVPs, this game didn't disappoint - but once again, it was the Golden State Warriors who prevailed, matching the best 50-game start to a season, equaling the Wilt Chamberlain-led 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers, who also started 46-4.  Roll right along without  and  in the lineup. Their annual \"Rodeo Road Trip\" starts Tuesday in Miami on TNT.   Thunder can take a lot of positives from their loss to the Warriors, but they did get sliced up on D for far too many stretches.   , last dozen games: 12.8 points, 10.6 rebounds, 52.6 percent from the floor. The Raptors will take those averages for the rest of time. Valanciunas Finishes StrongDeMar DeRozan drives baseline and finds the open man, feeding Jonas Valanciunas who drops the hammer.

Attention to detail does the Cavs in Friday as they blow a four-point lead in the final 10 seconds at home against Boston.

Three double-digit losses in four games, and the fourth was a loss to the Lakers.

How can any one person, or team, make a meaningful difference on the ground in Flint, Mich.?  But how can you not try?  The filtered water comes, day after day, so fast that they don't know where to put it all. The damage, though -- insidious, unseen -- is all around the city, in the eyes of the children who drank from the Flint River, and who will suffer the rest of their lives because no one told them the water wasn't safe.  Thousands of people drank the water from the Flint River, which became the city's main water source in April, 2014, even though the water in that river is more corrosive than the water the city had previously used from Detroit, and the city didn't use corrosion controls to keep lead in the water from leaching into pipes. Even though separate, independent investigations found alarmingly elevated levels over the next two years, and residents complained about smell and color of their drinking water, the state government did not switch back to Detroit's water system until October, 2015.  By then, it was too late. Thousands of residents complained about physical ailments, especially in their children, many of whom had highly elevated levels of lead in their blood. Lead poisoning in children has been linked to developmental and physical disabilities. I can tell you that the entire organization, the coaches, the players, the entire staff at the Pistons and the Palace, we're all committed to making a difference. This is not going to be a one-month effort of writing some checks. We're going to be involved and continue to be of help and support to this community.\u2013 Vice Chairman of Palace Sports and Entertainment Arn Tellem \"When the story first came out, a lot of residents had kind of been complaining already, saying this water is brown and it's making me break out and different things like that,\" Morris Peterson said Saturday.  \"So after the story came out, it's kind of like, I'm trying to think about how bad it is. I know its bad. But it's like, every day, every couple of days, it's worse. I can't imagine this happening in the United States right now -- if you had told me this would be happening in the United States right now, in 2016, I wouldn't have believed it.\"  Peterson, who played 10 years in the NBA for the Raptors, New Orleans Hornets and the Thunder, grew up in Flint, and went to Flint Northwestern High. He now lives in Grand Blanc, about 15 minutes south of Flint. But he has cousins, uncles and aunts who still live there. He owns a couple of small apartment units there, and he wants to open a juice bar downtown in the summer.  And, he still gets his hair cut in Flint.  \"Not too long ago, I got my hair washed there,\" he said, \"and got my face washed there, everything and stuff. And the next day, my face broke out a little bit. And I was thinking it was the barber. I was thinking it was his clippers or something like that. I went and I bought my own clippers after that. I thought it was his clippers, and come to find out it was the water. You look at businesses. They have to get water filters. What are they going to do? All these businesses are affected by it.\"  And Tom Gores, who grew up in Flint, too, was spurred to try and do something.  Gores, the Detroit Pistons' owner, . Arn Tellem, the former high-powered player agent who joined the organization last fall as Vice Chair of Palace Sports and Entertainment, was in Flint Friday meeting with philanthropic and charity organizations, and returned Sunday morning to meet with local leaders and hear presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who came to Flint and spoke at a local church.  \"We're committed, starting with Tom,\" Tellem said Sunday. \"He's a native. He's deeply concerned about Flint, and cares about it. I can tell you that the entire organization, the coaches, the players, the entire staff at the Pistons and the Palace, we're all committed to making a difference. This is not going to be a one-month effort of writing some checks. We're going to be involved and continue to be of help and support to this community. It's sustaining it, and we get that. And Tom's committed, and I'm committed. Everyone that's involved in this effort is committed to seeing it through.\"  Gores brought Tellem from a comfortable life representing players to working in and around Detroit, including trying to work on a new local television deal and a potential new downtown arena. But he also has challenged Tellem to help expand the Pistons' footprint in the local community. But it's like, every day, every couple of days, it's worse. I can't imagine this happening in the United States right now -- if you had told me this would be happening in the United States right now, in 2016, I wouldn't have believed it.\u2013 Former NBA guard and Flint, Mich., native Morris Peterson Tellem never envisioned he'd be meeting with local leaders about lead poisoning. But this is where they are needed.  \"Part of having a community asset is having social responsibility,\" Tellem said. \"I really admire Tom for stepping up for Flint. Being here on the ground, my hope is I can execute his vision to make a difference.\"  In addition to the $10 million pledge from Gores, .  It is here where one tries not to be cynical.  There is nothing -- nothing -- wrong with donating money. We do it all the time to try and help others in their time of need. There is nobility in giving back. There is nothing wrong with , former Piston Rasheed Wallace and Detroit native Derrick Coleman sending separate trucks full of bottled water there, or Detroit Lions defensive lineman Ziggy Ansah giving 94,000 bottles of water.  But while Flint needs water, it needs so much more. And there are so many horror stories of well-intentioned people whose donations in times of crisis never get to the people affected.  Tellem says Gores and the Pistons are into Flint's recovery for the long haul.  \"There are different needs,\" Tellem said. \"One is really the infrastructure to deliver water, food, filters to the community. There's a lot of people who can't drive, providing bus vouchers. It's unbelievable what has to happen here to get things delivered so everyone has the benefit. There's just a total lack of trust in the government. So the private sector, the foundations are the ones that are filling a huge void that was left by the government.\"  Gores put $1 million up immediately, with $250,000 of it going to the United Way of Genesse County Friday morning. It was granted out to food banks, Catholic Charities and other on-the-ground entities that are serving local residents in a couple of hours.  \"Arn and the group that is sort of on the ground from Platinum Equity took a great deal of tine to come and meet with us and find out what was going on,\" United Way CEO Jamie Gaskin said Sunday afternoon. \"The commitment of $10 million is a commitment that will take place over time. We expect them to not only invest in the immediate recovery but the long-term health care fund that's been set up for these kids, and even looking into and exploring economic development, because that's such an important part of our community. Even with this tragedy and challenge, we have to have jobs. People have to live here. Our expectation is that they're going to continue to stay plugged in here as they continue to make that longer term commitment.\"  And in the long term, $10 million is a drop in the bucket.  \"I think the $10 million does help,\" Peterson said. \"But I think with (President) Obama pledging to bring so many dollars here, its going to be a long process. You're talking about everyone's pipes in their house that have to be changed, replaced. Do we treat it like (Hurricane) Katrina and move people to different cities until it gets done? This is a real problem. You're talking about uprooting people from where they are. When you think about the big picture, I mean every little bit helps. (But) I think the government has to step in. I look at this as a billion dollar project. The water has been a band-aid, and they need it for now. But this is a big project.\"  It is staggering to consider what it will take to truly rebuild Flint, a former thriving town where 40 percent of residents now live below the poverty line. What business doesn't need clean water? Think about it; is there an office building that doesn't have drinking fountains, or bathrooms, or cafeterias? (The General Motors engine plant in Flint was one of the first to notice the water problem; its engine blocks were rusting much faster than they should have after coming off the assembly lines. GM switched from Flint water to nearby Flint Township water in December, 2014.)  Flint Mayor Karen Weaver has said it will cost more than $40 million to take out the lead service lines in 1,500 homes.  It will take decades to find out exactly how harmed the estimated 8,000 kids between 0-6 years of age were by the lead exposures -- years and years of cognitive testing. Every child will have different injuries. (The blood test for lead has to be administered within Expanded Head Start programs for those kids, who will need more attention in the system, will be $8,000 per child. The fund that has been set up to try and help those kids has a goal of $100 million.) The attention is going to go away from this problem as the water goes back to normal. But the children and the people that have been exposed, they don't ever get to go back to normal.\u2013 United Way CEO Jamie Gaskin \"If you have a child in that age range, it's hard to tell that parent, 'well, we just don't have enough money to give your kid that extra chance they need,' \" Gaskin said. \"The science around lead is very precise. People have been struggling with this issue with lead for some time. We know that it lowers IQ. If you're a parent and your kid has been exposed significantly over the last couple of years, what does it mean to lower your child's IQ a few points?...  \"The attention is going to go away from this problem as the water goes back to normal. But the children and the people that have been exposed, they don't ever get to go back to normal.\"  That mental anguish has a cost down the road, too.  \"A lot of the residents, a lot of the people I've been talking to -- because it's affected some of the members of my family -- they're scared,\" Peterson said. \"They don't know what's going on. They've got to be able to figure out ways (to use water) Imagine not being able to take a bath, or drink the water. They're making us pay for it. A lot of residents are mad. It's anxiety, it's fear. A lot of them really don't know what the future's going to hold. It's just tough. But this has opened up a lot of the problems that were already existing, not only in Flint, but in a lot of these urban communities.\"  And this is where Gores' pledge can do the most good.  The medical community, the philanthropic community and the direct service community are trying to figure out the next two decades on the fly, in the midst of chaos. What will 30 days out look like in Flint? Sixty days? Six months? Five years? And how do you save funds for those days when so many people need help now?  \"This is why gifts of this magnitude are so critical,\" Gaskin said. \"We need to take federal support. We need federal and state government to step in. But then we need to supplement those dollars with private dollars. There will be large gaps that we have to try and bridge to make a wrong right.\" A lot of the residents, a lot of the people I've been talking to ... they're scared. They don't know what's going on. ... A lot of residents are mad. It's anxiety, it's fear. A lot of them really don't know what the future's going to hold.\u2013 Morris Peterson Tellem said the Pistons are talking with other corporations to try and get short- and long-term commitments.  \"Our first focus was just go get in there and learn what was going on, and it's a step by step process,\" he said. \"But now, there have been banks and other businesses that have been reaching out. 'Cause I think everyone has been sort of overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenge, but our hope is we'll be able to pull people together in the business community, and there have been a number now who've reached out to us.\"  On the ground, Peterson will play in a charity basketball game in Flint Feb. 20 featuring fellow \"Flintstones\" Mateen Cleaves and Charlie Bell, and former Syracuse player Eric Devendorf. Peterson says Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo has offered to help any way he can.  Peterson still gets water bills from the tenants in his buildings. Some of them are up to $1,000. The citizens of Flint have to pay for the water that is poisoning them, and their children.  \"For me, I feel like everybody in Flint that I know, they're part of my family,\" Peterson said. \"The whole city. The support they've given me over the years, I wouldn't be where I am without Flint, without them. So I've got to be there for them.\"     The Peeps wanted to talk about . Go. From     You're being a little too literal in your interpretation of my phrasing, Hadi. No, it was no offensive. It was use of exaggeration to make a point. No, I don't you're \"wrong-minded\" if you disagree with me. I am not an absolutist; as I wrote, if anyone has an idea of how to make this better, I want to hear it. The Starters: Redick's Hack on DrummondSmart move? Annoying move? Both? Will it change \"Hack-A-Shaq\" rules? From                 Okay, Robert, let me ask you: did you consistently foul the worst free throw shooters on the opposing team when you played pickup? Did your high school team hack your rival's worst free throw shooter and put him on the foul line 36 times? Did your intramural team jump on the back of the frat house's worst free throw shooter in the final minutes of a tight game? I'm guessing the answer is no to all three questions. Why? Because y'all wanted to find out who the better team was by playing the game, not by having a free throw shooting contest. There is a qualitative difference between leaving a bad jump shooter open and deliberately fouling someone and putting them on the foul line 15+ times. I know you know the difference.  From               The Starters: Hacking In 2015 PlayoffsThe 'Hack-A-Whoever' was the biggest issue of the 2014-15 postseason. Here's what an NBA coach pointed out to me, Ken: the NBA is the only basketball league in the world -- in the world! -- that allows intentional fouling off the ball. Nobody else does -- not in high school, not in college, not in international play. That points out the absurdity of the practice. And Hack-a is not limited to the last two minutes, as the Rockets proved against Detroit. I'm okay with your idea on two free throws, but as I wrote, I don't want to completely eliminate Hack-a; I just want to make it less beneficial for the team that does it.  Someone now wants to talk about something else. Sorry. From       I think you're right on the money, John. Blake is the guy that sells tickets in L.A. -- he did when Donald Sterling owned the Clips, and he does now. His presence, or lack thereof, would also make a big difference in the team's potential takeaway from its new local TV deal. I will be very surprised if the Clips trade him, either by the deadline or this summer. He's just too valuable for the franchise.        He's got in-the-building range.   Monday's win over Orlando marked just the second time all season that Leonard didn't attempt a free throw during a game.  Hasn't scored fewer than 25 points in a game since Jan. 17 (10 games, in which he's averaged 32.1 per game. Wow).   Averaging 7.6 rebounds per game, along with 24.0 points and 10.0 assists per game. To average a triple-double for the season, with his current numbers, he'd have to average 14.2 rebounds per game the rest of the way.   He's never been a great 3-point shooter, but 26.7 percent this season? Yikes.    -- Consecutive wins by the Nuggets at home over the Bulls after Saturday's come-from-behind win against Chicago, rallying from a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit. The Bulls' last win in Denver . (No, you can add correctly; Chicago didn't play at Denver during the 2011-12 lockout season, so the Bulls have only played nine games in Denver in 10 years.) Bulls vs. NuggetsDanilo Gallinari scores 33 points to top Derrick Rose's 30 and nine boards, as Denver wins it, 115-110.  -- Games in which the Spurs have trailed at home in the fourth quarter this season, the third coming, quite surprisingly, at the hands of the Lakers Saturday night -- though San Antonio pulled away late for its 37th straight regular season win at AT&T Center.  -- Career steals for Clippers teammates Chris Paul and , tied for 18th on the NBA's all-time list, 23 behind 17th place Shawn Marion.     . (This has Kareem's \"one trick pony\" quote about . I think there's context here that shows the comment wasn't as bad as it seems, but judge for yourself.)   but it's already looking like another episode of Clippers-Grizz in the first round could be in the offing. Seven games of nasty. Sign me up!     but especially Manning, whom I hope will ride off into the sunset after a second Super Bowl title. But, it's his life and career. He can do what he wants. (Though I hope he retires.)    given the team's dreadful performances through much of the first half of the season, but everyone owns this, starting with Robert Sarver and GM Ryan McDonough. The big choices that have been made in the last two years -- signing  from Sacramento, which alienated ; trading Thomas to Boston and Dragic to Miami at the deadline last year; trading  but keeping ; giving  a big contract to try and entice  to sign last summer -- have blown up in the Suns' faces.  on the deaths of so many former NBA players, both in the past few months and years, in middle age.   I'll leave it at that.  We'll return with another 8,000 words or so Feb. 22.       Hawks vs. MagicKyle Korver scores 19 points and hands out five assists to lead the Hawks past the Magic, 103-100.       We were talking in the studio last night, and the thought was it might be better for you all not to be running away with the conference and division like you did last year, because you'll be sharper at the end of the regular season than you were last year, when a lot guys sat getting ready for the playoffs.   Yeah, in some ways, I kind of felt we didn't play a meaningful game for like a month and a half before the playoffs started last year. You always want to be playing your best basketball right now, as players, as coaches, as an organization. You want to feel like you're doing your best every day. I really feel like we're heading toward our best basketball. I feel like we're on track to get there.   Can I ask you about you? I know it's not your favorite subject.  Yeah.  I know a player's shot is a personal thing, like a pitcher's release point or a golfer's putting stance. But do you feel like with the new release point you have on the shot, that it feels right again? Korver's And-One 3-PointerKyle Korver drains the spot-up 3-pointer and gets fouled for the four point play opportunity.  I feel like I don't think I'm trying to put anything back together any more. I think that's the biggest thing for me. After the surgeries it really took a lot longer for the dots to connect for me than I thought it would. You don't ever want to be a mechanical basketball player, but as far as technique and things, I like to have certain check points in my shot, certain things that I can count on and think about. It kind of helps me to be consistent. For a good part of the season, the dots weren't connecting. It was super frustrating. It hasn't been a great shooting season, the first part of the season especially, it's been a struggle. But I feel like the last little bit here, things are coming together, and it's got me excited about the last part of the year.   Your shooting numbers were much better last month (38.7 percent on threes in January, after shooting 29 percent in December). Does the combo of the elbow feeling good and seeing the ball go in the basket more make you feel like you can get back to where you were last year?   Yeah. My body feels healthy again. I feel like things have healed, and I'm back and whole. There was, I felt like I missed so many shots for a while, and I think mentally, that does throw you a little bit. The last month, having a few better games has been good for me. I mean, at the end of the day, shooting is about confidence and the right mindset. At the end of the day, you have to make a few shots to feel right. I feel like I'm heading in the right direction, so I'm excited.  After last year, there was a standard set for where we wanted to be as a team. ... It feels like the last couple of weeks, there's been some good conversations. It feels like the ship is turning back in the right direction.\u2013 Atlanta Hawks shooting guard Kyle Korver  I still marvel how much confidence matters, even at this level.   The mental side of sports, it's huge. It's such a massive part of the game. You can visualize and you can try to trick yourself into thinking a certain way. There's all kinds of things you can do to try to get in the right spot mentally. But at the end of the day. To have real confidence, you've got to be doing good at your craft. For me, mentally, it was like I was guessing all of the time or trying something new today. Trying to figure out something out in warmups, that's not a good head space to be in. It doesn't exactly give you a ton of confidence. For me, just feeling like I'm settled back into my mechanics, more than anything, that really helps with the mental side of things.   Did Bud or the coaches do anything in particular -- maybe a new set or look to get you a good shot, or anything verbal -- to encourage you to stick with it, that it was going to come back?   More than anything, it's not always what coaches do, it's what coaches don't do. A player senses when a coach loses confidence in him. That more than anything can throw a player. Bud, he's so good at Xs and Os, or drawing up a new play or a new wrinkle or something to try and get you a shot. He's really good at that. But, not just me, but from a player's standpoint, we sense when someone loses confidence in you more than when someone's really trying to throw you a bone. Everyone knows, the guys on our coaching staff know, who's coming off a couple of surgeries. Going into the season, I think people knew it wasn't going to be perfect in the beginning. Moreso than anything, you think when people stick with you and have your back, and don't lose faith in you, and feel like the next one's going to go in, that probably does more for you than anything else. Korver Drains The Three Kyle Korver hits the contested 3-pointer from the top of the key.   Do you sense that helps other guys on the team as well, like Baze? He plays with a lot of emotion; does he need people to show they're confident in him?  Baze is never hurting for confidence. Baze always has ultimate belief in himself and what he's capable of doing. He sees the trajectory that he's on and where he's headed in his basketball career. One of the ultimate strengths of our coaching staff, and really the organization now, is that they're just a real positive vibe. You really feel like everyone's pulling for you and everyone's trying to help you get better. There's obviously constructive criticism, and we have film sessions and we try to hold each other accountable. But you really feel the coaching staff is pulling for you and they're putting in the work with you on off days, shootarounds, whenever you want. We've got a really bunch of solid people kind of running the ship here, and it feels like people really have your back. With players, that really creates a healthy environment, where you don't just feel like pawns in the game.   Do you talk with Marcus during the season about your shooting or mechanics?  Marcus is one of my good friends in life. We talk quite a bit. If we're going to talk about basketball or performance, or anything like that, we're going to talk regardless. He's created a great partnership with our new training staff, too. They've been excellent this year. It's a whole new team. They're totally open minded and outside the box thinkers trying to find any way that we can be better. Been really impressed with them this year. They've helped me out a ton. Korver Shines In New OrleansKyle Korver scores 22 points, hitting all eight of his shots, including four from 3-point range, as the Hawks beat the Pelicans, 121-115.   Is there an example of that?   They've done a lot of things. A lot of us deal with knees or ankles or hips. Most of us have something that we're always kind of trying to manage. It's just what kind of happens when you play basketball. They have a really holistic approach to how they look at your body and evaluate it, not just treat the knee that's hurting, but trying to understand the movement pattern that's causing the hurt knee or the hurt hip, or whatever it is. They're really excellent with the physical therapy side of everything, not just treating what's hurt, but really trying to be proactive and trying to make this not happen again. There's been a whole lot of buy in from our whole team, not just me. Guys that you never really see in the training room much, coming in. They're coming in because they feel a difference in their body. They're really feeling a difference as they're doing these extra exercises and therapies. They're into our sleep and our eating. Everyone's always been into those things but they've kind of taken it to a new level that I've never been around. I mean, a lot of those things just give you information, blood testing, working with nutritionists, working with sleep doctors, all of these things. They really see the whole thing. I feel like everyone's kind of really learned a lot.   You keeping a sleep diary? For a good part of the season, the dots weren't connecting. It was super frustrating. ... But I feel like the last little bit here, things are coming together, and it's got me excited about the last part of the year.\u2013 Atlanta Hawks shooting guard Kyle Korver  I don't keep a sleep diary. But especially on road trip, they give us target sleep times -- sleep from here to there. They're doing a good job of when shootarounds are, when practices are, when flights are, things around guys trying to get better sleep, trying to work with different medications. If you have a hard time sleeping, making sure you have a certain amount of sleep at certain times. Everything kind of works together: sleeping, eating, exercises, therapies. It's how do you get a plan? I think what's really cool about this right now is the coaching staff, obviously with Bud being in the front office, the training staff, everyone's on the same page. Everyone's putting together a singular plan for each player, where all these things are involved.   I know there were some bad losses early. Do you think there's room for growth in the second half of the season?   I feel like we're a better team than we were last year. I think we're a more talented team. Guys who've come back are better. Paul [Millsap]'s better than he was last year. Al [Horford]'s added 3-point shooting. Jeff [Teague] has added to his game; Dennis [Schroder] is playing at a higher level; Baze adds something to us we didn't have before, another ballhandler, another person who can create off the dribble. Our bench is a year deeper, another year of experience, another year that we've been together. A lot of it for us is finding that mental focus and that sense of urgency that we have to play with. When we're really at our best we're playing as one. The ball is moving. We have tons of activity on defense, so we're causing turnovers and getting out on the break. But to do that stuff, you really have to have a sharp mindset. I think at the beginning of the year, I don't know why, but I didn't feel like we had that urgency for quite a while. Those losses have been a reminder that we do have to play a certain way for us to be good. After last year, there was a standard set for where we wanted to be as a team. I think we all felt the slippage. I think we all felt it from top to bottom. It feels like the last couple of weeks, there's been some good conversations. It feels like the ship is turning back in the right direction.    -- Hornets center  (), Thursday, 9:12 p.m. Probably a good call.     -- Clippers owner ,  that Blake Griffin will be disciplined by the team for punching assistant equipment manager Mathias Testi during a fight at a Toronto restaurant late last month.

It's the so-called Rodeo Trip, an annual exercise that tests defensive abilities and packing skills, boxing out on the boards and sacking out on airplanes, late-game execution and late-night arrivals. It's about jump shots and jet-lag, running the floor and running for the plane, catching passes wherever they're thrown and catching Zs whenever you can.  It is long and tiring, yet frantic and often inspiring. It is a 6,500-mile journey that will take the Spurs from coast-to-coast for eight games, hitting four states, seven cities and three time zones over the course of 20 days, eventually delivering them back to San Antonio with more answers than questions. After all, it is the road where NBA championship mettle is often forged in an us-against-the-world atmosphere.  Many NBA teams are forced out of their multi-purpose home arenas at roughly the same time every year. The Chicago Bulls' annual Circus Trip has them on the road for several weeks each November while lions, tigers and clowns take over the United Center. The Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers have to clear out when Grammys occupy Staples Center.  The Spurs' journey is a tradition born of necessity when they moved from the Alamodome to the AT&T Center for the 2002-03 season. The team is forced to vacate its home each year for a large portion of February for the bull-riding, calf-roping activities of .  But it is a tradition that the Spurs have made the very most of, churning out a 75-34 (.688) record over the past 13 seasons. That's better than their overall road mark of 278-186 (.599) during that span.  What they are trying not to think about is last season when the Spurs had a losing record (4-5) on the rodeo trip for the first time ever. At one point they lost four in a row and coach Gregg Popovich insisted that they have a players-only meeting. GameTime: Spurs Rodeo Woes In 2015The GameTime crew discuss the Spurs road woes. \"I don't even want to think about what we did last year,\"  told reporters on Monday.  In the first year of the Rodeo Trip (2003), the Spurs lost on their first stop at Minnesota, then ran off eight wins in a row and four months later claimed their second NBA championship. Two years later (2005), the Spurs blitzed through the Rodeo Trip with a 5-2 record and went on to win championship No. 3.  Thus a legend, and perhaps a myth, began to grow -- that they need the trip. That it somehow makes them stronger.  There are more guesses about reasons for the Spurs' success than seeds inside a jalape\u00f1o pepper. It's often been speculated that they use the trip as one of those Outward Bound adventures that is supposed to change your life.  While the chance to bond as teammates during a long does have significance, the annual sojourn also comes along at just the right time in the NBA calendar to benefit the Spurs most. Popovich doesn't get stressed by too much that happens in the standings through the first two months of the season and then, as he gets a better understanding and feel for his personnel, uses January and early February to tinker with lineups and check out different looks. By the time the Rodeo Trip arrives, Pop is usually ready to zero in on what's working and refines his plan for the playoffs.  The trip begins with a back-to-back set  and  Tuesday and Wednesday, then after a weeklong break for the All-Star Game, makes stops in L.A. for both  , , ,  and . The team is off to a franchise-record 28-0 start at home, but won't play its next game at the AT&T Center until .

Ginobili's absence will get even more playing time off the bench for  and Jonathan Simmons. Ginobili Leaves The GameManu Ginobili suffers a testicular injury during the fourth quarter.  The immediate question is how much longer Popovich can hold off champing-at-the-bit , who has sat out seven straight games and eight of the last nine dating back to Jan. 17 due to soreness in his right knee. There had been some thought that Popovich might want to rest Duncan through the All-Star break. But teammate  said the big fella is getting antsy to get back in the lineup.  \"If he doesn't do it, I think he's going to leave,\" Parker cracked. \"He can't take it anymore (sitting).\"  Even if Duncan doesn't play, the Spurs 12-2 with  as a starter.  This is a time when last summer's high-profile free-agent addition, , looks to be settling comfortably into the lineup after a half season of finding his way. Gone is the hesitation and he's playing instinctively again. On Monday, Aldridge was  after averaging 26 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.5 blocked shots while shooting 59.7 percent in four games.  The Spurs left on the trip packing a 43-8 record, . They have just two sets of back-to-back games, but will play five in eight nights near the end.  But, of course, it ain't their first rodeo.  \"It's a great time for us to gel as a team, especially this year because we have a lot of young guys and new guys,\" Parker said. \"It's a great opportunity just to spend time together and make sure we get ready for the playoffs.\"      "},

The Raptors have been a very worthy and inspiring opening act for the last few months, if you haven't noticed.   got on a treadmill in the off-season and returned as a size 6.  is a smarter and more efficient shooter and together they're the best backcourt east of Oakland. A good supporting cast continues to be consistent. Dwane Casey once again is the best coach that casual basketball fans have never heard of. They're winning. They've got the Cavs looking over their shoulder. They The North.  Of course, it's not their role as an opening act that will define their season. For a team that couldn't escape the first round of the playoffs the last few years, and quite honestly swallowed a grapefruit last spring, it's what they do in closing that will count most. And we'll get to that in a bit.  For now? This is the best basketball in Toronto since  had vertical, performed at a level that gives hope if nothing else. After starting the season 7-6 they've had the best record in the East and are giving off the impression, at least, that there's indeed a suspenseful race at the top.  Nobody seems quick to declare the Raptors, two games out of first place as the week began, worthy of being in the same discussion with the Cavs. They lost by 22 to  last month and the Cavs appear recharged with a new coach. We'll know better when these two see each other after the break at the Air Canada Centre, which certainly will once again be juiced. The mere thought of the Raptors pulling ahead of the Cavs would send chills through Cleveland and be somewhat of a shock to everyone else.  Yet the Raptors have put themselves in position to do that, and this comes as a bit of a surprise. This is a team that for the next few months will be without , its prized free agent signing, to knee issues (and he was a mild disappointment before he got hurt). And the Raptors cut ties with , one of their better big men.  Oh, and they were left bleeding last spring by the Wizards after a first-round sweep (getting waxed by 31 points in the clincher), and suddenly Casey was coaching for his life this season. Not only were the Raptors atrocious defensively, but Lowry was a non-factor, which created concern about whether he had peaked as a player. Remember when  famously said the Raptors didn't have \"it,\" implying that Toronto lacked a special something-something to get over the hump? Well, Lowry was supposed to be part of the solution, and he wasn't. Kia Awards: Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozanThe Raptors' Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan are co-winners of the Kia Eastern Conference Player of the Month award! But he shed most of that Goodyear tire he dragged along and is back to his ornery self on the court and playing with a purpose.  and Sunday will get the second-biggest applause after  when the All-Star starters are announced.  \"It's about being a better player today than you were yesterday,\" Lowry said. \"We're all trying to do that as a team.\"  Likewise,  and is refreshingly efficient (45 percent) despite taking more shots than ever. Whether by design or simply coincidence, he's producing at a high rate here in his contract year, and it's all good for him and the Raptors even if they must write him a big free agent check this summer (DeRozan says he wants to stay put). Lowry and DeRozan work well together because there's a mutual respect, they don't clash style-wise or personality-wise, and they genuinely like each other.  \"He's about to hit his prime right now,\" said Lowry. \"He's playing with a lot of confidence, and you get the feeling the best has yet to come. I can see him being a perennial All-Star.\"  , the big fella, has been ... fine. Not spectacular. And the Raptors must wonder if he'll ever be more than a mild double-double guy (at this point, probably not). But he does his part near the rim and is the only low-post offense on the roster. Inside Stuff: Cory Joseph in TorontoGrant Hill catches up with Raptors guard Cory Joseph in his hometown of Toronto, site of NBA All-Star 2016. It might be too early to wonder if respected GM Masai Ujiri whiffed a little on Carroll, who has only played 23 games. We'll see once he returns if he can be the same player he was with the Hawks last season. That said, Ujiri did nicely elsewhere with his gets: ,  and . All three have been better than expected, especially Biyombo. The Hornets lost patience with the former lottery pick, a raw but bouncy power forward without an ounce of offensive skill, and that allowed Ujiri to get him cheap.  Biyombo may never hear his number called for a play in his career, but the energy he brings defensively and on the glass makes up for that.  and redirects opponent's shots. Remember, the lack of defense managed to destroy this team last year, especially in the playoffs.  It all reflects well on Casey. Two years ago when the Raptors came under new management, Casey was on thin ice. At the time, there was support in Toronto for the Raptors tanking in order to increase the odds of drafting the hometown product, . But Casey dug in and brought about a culture change and there isn't a coach in the East who's doing better work.  Toronto has signature wins over the Clippers and Heat twice, the Cavs and Spurs, and played the Warriors tight, losing two games by a combined eight points. There is little use questioning their authenticity; but it's fair to wonder if they're in Cleveland's class or merely the best of the teams chasing the Cavs.  \"I think teams are like, `Oh, there's Toronto, I don't know if they're good enough' or whatever,\" Casey told reporters recently. \"That's fine. That's cool. We'd rather have that. We have to continue to earn the respect by going in and playing with a sense of urgency, with force on both ends of the floor and having a focus for 48 minutes.  \"I don't know if we're all the way there yet. Teams don't know if we're for real or not but that's fine. That's good because it means with have to continue to earn the respect, which I think we're doing.\"      "},

Rushmore. Cold and hard.  But behind the grumpy puss that snarls at sidelines reporters and all but chews up microphones are the traits of Gregg Popovich that have turned the San Antonio Spurs into the model NBA franchise, if not all of professional sports over the past two decades.  Consistency, loyalty, curiosity and uncompromising commitment to the whole and an ability to not conflate winning basketball games with something significant in the world.  Truth is, the 67-year-old Popovich would rather be other places than on the sidelines in Toronto  for the fourth time.  \"When he first got the word that he was named, I'm sure Pop was asking, 'Why? Why? Why?' \" said Wizards assistant coach Don Newman, who was a member of the Spurs' staff for seven seasons. \"He was thinking he could just be (at his vacation home) in Maine, drinking good wine. The Starters: Gregg Popovich's LegacyCelebrating the coaching career of Gregg Popovich.  \"But now that Pop's going, even if he's been there before, he'll be sure to make the experience worthwhile for himself, his staff and for all those players. He connects.\"  In a league that has now seen 223 coaching changes since he took over the job in San Antonio on Dec. 10, 1996. Last month,  leading the Cavaliers, yet Popovich has endured to make the Spurs the symbol of stability and excellence.  \"It's the way that he's created a culture there in San Antonio where people want to be a part of it and people want to be there,\" said Houston Rockets interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff. \"It's players. It's front office people. It's an environment of trust. It's a family-type environment where every man and woman is looking out for the next man or woman. They don't short each other in anything. They value character. They value commitment. It started with him 20 years ago or however long it was. He bled that into that organization and that organization has continued with it under his leadership.\" I mean, he's been so open with me and I've been a sponge every chance I get to be around him. I talk to him a lot about the game, I ask him questions about the game, how he teaches the game.\u2013 Kobe Bryant, on Gregg Popovich \"Number one, he's true to himself,\" said Lakers coach Bryon Scott. \"He's been able to coach guys with that stern hand as well. Pop is a military guy. It's a 'do it this way or we got to get rid of you' type attitude. What I've admired is I've seen him take  out of the game and yell and scream at him and  the same way. It doesn't matter who it is. He treats them all the same way. Of course, it's great that you have guys like that who are superstars like a T.D. that accept it. You just marvel at it. They've been playing this way for a number of years. Nobody cares who scores.\"  It's a system and a culture that's been established in San Antonio because Popovich and Duncan bonded early and nurtured an enduring of trust. Champions Revealed: New BeginningsTim Duncan and Gregg Popovich look back to Tim's early days in the NBA. \"When your star guy is allowing you to coach him like he does and like he has for all these years, then it makes it that much easier to coach Tony and Manu (Ginobili),\" Scott said. \"Then a young guy like  comes in and he sees this on an everyday basis and he knows how it all works. It makes for a system that just keeps building on itself.\"  Under Popovich, the Spurs have made 18 consecutive playoff appearances, set an NBA record with 16 straight 50-win seasons and won five championships.  \"Greatness in this league is consistency,\" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. \"The fact that Pop has done it for over 20 years in one place and the absolute gold standard of consistency, that speaks for itself. That's unheard of in this league.\"  What's rare is Popovich's ability to communicate with and demand the same level of effort and team-first responsibility across the gamut of players from future Hall of Famers Duncan, Parker and Ginobili to the freshest rookie or 10-day signee at the end of the bench.  \"Get over yourself!\" It's the Pop mantra that makes the entire program work. To always get an honest opinion from somebody with that type of resume? Sounds easy, right? No, that's so rare in this culture I'll be the first one to admit that Pop's not for everybody. But he's for real.\u2013 Former Spur Gary Neal, on Coach Gregg Popovich It is perhaps fitting that in his 18th and final All-Star Game Lakers star  will get to be coached by Popovich. It has been a relationship of rivals, but one where bonds have formed out of mutual respect.  \"It's been amazing,\" Bryant said. \"I mean, he's been so open with me and I've been a sponge every chance I get to be around him. I talk to him a lot about the game, I ask him questions about the game, how he teaches the game.  \"One of my favorite times that I spent with him was during the All-Star game when he was coaching. He came up to me right before practice and he said, 'Hey, should I do a real practice or like a whatever walk-through All-Star practice?\" I said, 'Do a real practice, because I want to see what the hell goes on in San Antonio, so you've got to do all the real stuff.' The guys were kind of looking around like: 'What the hell!' Tim just looked at me like, 'You're killing me.' I wanted to see what goes down.\" Duncan, Popovich Emotional After WinAfter winning the championship in a rematch in The Finals, Coach Gregg Popovich and Tim Duncan relish in the emotional victory. \"It all starts with Pop,\" Bickerstaff said. \"There's unique personalities everywhere and in every business and that's why everything is not the same. He's a very unique personality. The thing to me that you see it and you watch it is he'll cuss Tim Duncan out and then in the next situation, they're sitting down laughing. There's no grudges held. There's no ill intent. It's all about winning. It's all about winning together and winning the right way. And that's why they're the standard for organizations. Point blank. Period.\"  \"I was with him seven years and saw it up close every day,\" Newman said. \"He demands what he wants. The players are all in. Everybody talks. Everybody is on the same plane.  \"It goes way beyond the players. It's everything, everybody. From (general manager) R.C. (Buford) to the ticket sellers, everybody is on the same page and everybody communicates with everybody. You're over here and I'm over there, but everybody is together.  \"There is never an excuse: 'Well, I don't know what's going on.' Everybody knows what's going on and everybody knows where we want to go. You want to go to the top. And, of course, he's been winning.\" It's all about winning. It's all about winning together and winning the right way. And that's why they're the standard for organizations. Point blank. Period.\u2013 Houston Rockets interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff, on Popovich Yet the Spurs have not simply knocked down every obstacle in their part for 20 years. They have never won back-to-back titles. They have been knocked out of the playoffs in the first round four times during Popovich's tenure, . But the Spurs don't panic or overreact. Popovich takes stock and moves forward.  \"The players and Pop and us, everybody just says 'OK, here's where we came up short. So here's what we've got to take care of and we're going to do it together. We'll do it this way.' And that's the beauty of it. No finger-pointing. No blame. Just shared responsibility to fix it.\"  He totally revamped the offense from a low-post, inside-out game built around Duncan to playing up-tempo and relying on the 3-point shot that Popovich personally detests. He's made the transition from his early days of David Robinson and Sean Elliott with Duncan to this iteration of the Spurs built around All-Stars Leonard and . Champions Revealed: ReflectionsThe Spurs core group reflect on the memories they've shared over the years. However, while drawing the different Xs and Os, Popovich has always been able to get his players to buy in by connecting with them on a personal level.  \"The public Pop that everybody sees is not the person that comes to work every day,\" said Washington Wizards guard , who spent three years toiling in Europe before . \"He's a totally different guy. He takes an interest in the players. That's why everybody that goes through there pretty much does well.  \"Because he takes an interest in you and gets to know you, he can figure out what makes you tick and what makes you play better. I think he's mastered that. I think a lot of the coaches in the NBA don't take a personal interest in the players. They don't know what's going on in the player's life. They don't know what the player's going through. Pop, in my tenure there, he was able to do that.  \"I'm not just talking about locker room speeches or addressing the group. It's bigger than that.  \"It's like when a group is wishing somebody happy birthday it's not as special as when I come to you and say happy birthday. Pop will make that connection. He's able to come to you and say, 'Hey, how's your wife doing?' He'll call your wife by her first name. Call your kids by their first names. It gives you a sense that he cares about you. Any player, if you feel like the coach really cares about you, is gonna go out there and do the best you can do night in and night out.  \"Oh yeah, if you're messing up, he's gonna tell you the truth. But he tells you the good with the bad. That's another quality. He lets you know your role, what he expects of you night in and night out. To always get an honest opinion from somebody with that type of resume? Sounds easy, right? No, that's so rare in this culture.  \"I'll be the first one to admit that Pop's not for everybody.

The Heat announced Tuesday that they will retire O'Neal's No. 32 at the beginning of next season. He becomes the third player to get such a designation from the Heat, joining Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway.  Miami is also the second team to retire an O'Neal jersey, after the Los Angeles Lakers did so with the No. 34 he donned for that franchise.  \"Shaquille O'Neal is one of the truly elite players in the history of the game and one of the greatest players to ever wear a Heat uniform,\" Heat President Pat Riley said. \"He took us to another level as a basketball franchise while leading us to our first NBA championship.\"  Miami has also retired No. 23 in Michael Jordan's honor for contributions he made to basketball, but Jordan never played for the Heat.  While the breakup with O'Neal wasn't pleasant when he essentially forced Miami into trading him to Phoenix in 2008, the contributions that the Hall of Famer made to the franchise have never been questioned - or forgotten. Among players with at least 1,000 field goals for Miami, no one has a better shooting percentage than O'Neal, who is fifth on the team's all-time list in blocks despite only playing with the Heat for 3 1-2 seasons.  \"Retiring his number in the rafters, along with Heat greats Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway, is something we are very proud of,\" Riley said.  Other numbers likely to be retired by the Heat in future years include 's No. 3, ' No. 6 and 's No. 40.  "},

He was expected to be out four-to-six weeks while his hand heals from the Jan. 23 altercation in Toronto.  The spokesman said the fine was issued by the Clippers, with the NBA assisting in the investigation of the incident as well as in the disciplinary process. No other punishment from the league is expected.  The Clippers end a four-game road trip Wednesday night in Boston before the All-Star break this weekend.

He was close to returning from that injury when he punched Testi, who sustained multiple facial injuries. Both men were sent back to Los Angeles, where Griffin underwent a procedure on his hand.  There was no immediate comment from Griffin. He has been off Twitter since Jan. 26 when he posted an apology on the social media site, where he is a frequent user. He and Testi are friends and Griffin described him as \"someone I care about.\"  A person with knowledge of the incident said last month that Griffin and Testi got into an argument during dinner that escalated. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Clippers had not confirmed those details publicly. Rivers said later that both men had been drinking.  Griffin was averaging 23.2 points, 8.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists before being sidelined.

He's only 30 and yet approaching   and neither speaks of his leadership and fire, the immeasurable assets that are probably what he brings best. He's a complete point guard, someone who can be a scorer or distributor in a snap, depending on the situation and what the Los Angeles Clippers need from him. He also owns the highest assists and steals averages in All-Star Game history. I can tell you that nobody has greater expectations for Chris and his team than Chris himself.\u2013 Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers Being part of select company can also be unflattering, and Paul ranks there as well. Of the 43 players with nine or more All-Star appearances, eight have never won a championship. And so Paul is in the team photo with Dominique Wilkins, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley and John Stockton and a few others ... except nobody's smiling in it.  There's hope, though. At least he's still active, unlike the others, and can do something about it. But time can never be taken for granted, especially for someone who's had injuries interrupt seven of his 10 seasons, so believe Paul when he says: \"I play with a sense of urgency. I want to win one now.\"  Whenever Paul finishes up another season now, there will be either thrill or despair. There's no in-between anymore. Not this deep into his career. Over the last few years especially, when he had enough talent around him to make a run into June but fell short, Paul dealt with angst, both internal and external. Yes, suddenly, the point guard who's almost universally hailed as one of the very best at his position felt the sting of barbs heaved by the basketball public, which is now quick to bring his lack of championships to any conversation involving Paul.  Remember, Paul has yet to get beyond the semifinals.  And that feels strange, maybe even uncomfortable. Kia Awards: Chris PaulClippers guard Chris Paul is a nominee for the Kia Western Conference Player of the Month. \"I can tell you that nobody has greater expectations for Chris and his team than Chris himself,\" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \"He's a great, great leader.\"  This isn't  \u2014 and there's nothing wrong with that, because he's had quite a few good ones \u2014 nor his most challenging, but perhaps a bit of both. Paul has played well, especially considering the near-nightly challenges he gets against a swelling number of very good point guards. Plus, he's had to accomplish that while missing  for 20-plus games and counting. Once again he's   while averaging 19.0 points. Basically, Paul has upheld his high standards with little if any slippage.  \"He's one of the guys in this league that you can depend on, night in and out,\" said teammate . It's not like he's mentioning it every day, but of course Chris wants to win his first championship badly. I'm sure it drives him. It drives all of us.\u2013 Los Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford With Griffin staring at another month or so recovery from a broken hand (), the Clippers are stripped of a dependable scorer. But this is where Paul is most valuable. He can cover up most deficiencies. He can compensate for the Clippers missing Griffin's 23-point scoring average by taking big shots or, if necessary, set up teammates to help with the load. That's partly why the Clippers have  .  The one player they can least afford to lose is Paul, who puts everything in motion and dictates the flow. In that sense, Paul once again is defying those who said he was too small to be a star in a big man's game. Paul put that theory to rest long ago. He now enjoys a trophy case with All-NBA mentions and Olympic medals and owns a portfolio of product endorsement success -- his long-lost \"brother\" Cliff Paul is one of the more endearing fictional characters -- yet there's something missing. Yes, of course.  \"It's not like he's mentioning it every day, but of course Chris wants to win his first championship badly,\" said Crawford. \"I'm sure it drives him. It drives all of us.\"  It must drive Paul batty as well. Back in 2007-08, he and the old New Orleans Hornets took the league by storm, winning 56 games and reaching the Western Conference semifinals. After doing that in his third season, the projections for Paul were through the roof. Surely, he'd have plenty more cracks at a championship, right?  Since then, he was traded to the Clippers, . Los Angeles won 56 games in 2013-14, but Paul made errors that turned . Last season, he was epic for the Clippers in their , then hampered by a bad hamstring when the . Rockets-Clippers Series RecapRelive the epic seven-game series between the Rockets and Clippers from the Western Conference semifinals! It wasn't always his fault, but the playoff failures reflect more negatively on him than any of his teammates, mainly because he's the leader and best player and created so much early promise for himself. Great players eventually break through the ceiling and at least play for a championship (if not win one). Paul is still chasing the scent of one.  He finds himself back in a similar place, back in the All-Star Game and on a team that appears destined to win 50-plus games. That's a credit to Paul and his consistency, that he's in position to enter the playoffs with a chance.  But the Golden State Warriors, San Antonio Spurs and Thunder are looming and represent a bigger threat than Paul has ever seen in his career.  \"Chris doesn't have anything to prove to anyone as far as being one of the best in the game,\" Rivers said. \"I mean, that's pretty obvious. He knows what's missing and what all the all-time greats have on their resume, and he's determined to achieve that part. I wouldn't bet against him. We have to do our part to help him.\"  Someday, he'll be in the Hall of Fame. You just wonder if he'll be placed next to Barkley and Ewing.      "},

There is no truth to the rumor that next year, NBA D-League players who get hot while called up on a 10-day contract will be eligible to start for the East or West in the annual showcase event.  The Cavaliers . Lue is 7-3 in the not-quite-three-weeks since he got bumped up to replace him. The guy working the West bench Sunday, Gregg Popovich --  -- has a head start on Lue of about 1,059 victories, 246 playoff games and five NBA championships. GameTime: Tyronn LueThe new Cleveland Cavaliers coach, Tyronn Lue, talks about his hopes for the team.  One of those guys is an All-Star coach. The other will be managing All-Stars' minutes for a day, though not everyone sees it that way.  \"He deserves it because he was part of those 30 victories,\" said NBA Hall of Famer turned TNT analyst Reggie Miller. \"Everybody's saying, 'Can you believe he's coaching in the All-Star Game?' Yes. Because he was David Blatt's right-hand man. He was there for all those wins by Cleveland. I have zero problem with T-Lue coaching in the All-Star Game.\"  All those wins weren't enough to get Blatt to Toronto for the ceremonial shift Sunday, yet they helped provide Lue with a stage that typifies the development and unlikely hoops career he has pieced together across much of the past three decades.  Considering Lue's size (6-foot, 175 pounds in his playing days) and the underdog vibe that's been with him from the start, there is a curious Forrest Gump-Zelig thing going on with him. From the start of what became an 11-year NBA career -- remarkable, given his abilities and impact through much of it -- to where he is now as the coach charged with ending Cleveland's half-century championship drought, Lue has proven to be both a survivor and an opportunist. In the best, most confident and resilient ways.  \"My dream was to make it to the NBA, but when you're small, everybody says, 'Yeah, right,' \" Lue, now 38, told . \"It was a goal I had. It was a far-fetched goal, but it was something I was able to accomplish. People doubted me and I used it as motivation.\"  Turning challenges into positives? Seems to be something of a pattern for this guy.    Early in his NBA career with the Lakers, he blocked a dunk attempt by  in practice. Bryant at first challenged him to a fight, then demanded that they play 1-on-1 as a way for Bryant to restore his supremacy. Lue declined, which might have been the bravest part of the whole episode, given Bryant's clout even then within the organization in potentially getting the low-rung reserve banished from the roster.  Lue survived and stuck around through the 2001 Finals. He was the guy against whom Philadelphia's Allen Iverson made a last-minute corner jumper,  to add some insult to the scoreboard injury. At that moment, Lue looked destined to become literally a footnote in NBA history.    And yet, Lue persisted. He had provided the Lakers with an Iverson surrogate in practice -- right down to his size and braids -- and the three-time champions seized their middle title by sweeping the next four games. There are lots of NBA fans who got introduced to Lue on that play, him looking up vulnerably at Iverson, but it's nothing Lue regrets.  \"I think it meant the same thing it kind of means right now with getting this coaching job of not really being anybody and getting a chance to perform on a big stage, in the NBA Finals,\" . \"And going against, at that time, the MVP -- one of the top three best players in the NBA -- and just have a chance, coming out of nowhere, to try to take on that challenge has kind of been my life story, being the underdog.\"  And so it has gone for Tyronn Jamar Lue (his first name is pronounced tih-RAHN). Born in Mexico, Mo., he was raised by a single mother, Kim Miller, along with a brother and a sister; their father, Ron Lue, spent time in prison on drug convictions. As an adolescent, to safeguard against trouble, Lue was sent after his freshman year in high school to live with an aunt and uncle in Kansas City.  He made peace with his father's choices and credits that upbringing for his outlook to this day. He also became a dynamite playmaker and scorer at Raytown High School, averaging 23 points a game as a senior and leading his team to a 27-0 record before it was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 1995 Missouri state tournament. Everybody's saying, 'Can you believe he's coaching in the All-Star Game?' Yes. Because he was David Blatt's right-hand man. He was there for all those wins by Cleveland. I have zero problem with T-Lue coaching in the All-Star Game.\u2013 TNT analyst Reggie Miller Lue showed enough to earn a scholarship to the University of Nebraska, where he hiked up his game each year, averaging 21.2 points and 4.8 assists while making 37.3 percent of his 3-pointers in his final season with the Cornhuskers. That was good enough to make him the No. 23 pick in the 1998 NBA Draft, right behind Baylor's Brian Skinner and just ahead of St. John's Felipe Lopez. Of the 37 players selected after Lue that year, only seven played as many or more games in the NBA. None is involved, if at all, to the extent Lue is, coaching a championship contender.  \"He's a natural leader,\" Mark Scanlon, Lue's coach at Raytown, told the  when he moved into Blatt's job. \"He's got great people skills. Those two things always stood out, and that's a lot of coaching right there. He'll be good. ... When he played, he never talked about coaching. He just thought about playing. When he started helping Doc Rivers [in Boston and L.A.], I think he caught the bug then.\" GameTime: Barkley on BlattTNT's Charles Barkley weighs-in on the Cavaliers firing head coach David Blatt and hiring Tyronn Lue as head coach.   Lue's journeyman career --  -- exposed him to some of the league's best coaches and brightest talents. He played for Phil Jackson, Doug Collins, Rivers, Jeff Van Gundy, Scott Skiles, Avery Johnson and Stan Van Gundy. Among his teammates: Bryant, Shaquillle O'Neal, Michael Jordan, Tracy McGrady, Yao Ming, , Jason Kidd and .  Lue got comfortable dealing with stars -- a handy skill for a coach -- and he gave them something back: Lacking the abilities those guys had, as well as the size of most, he did demonstrate a drive that maybe the stars didn't always tap. At least, he provided a reminder of the value of hard work.  During his three season with the Lakers, Jackson once talked up Lue while explaining his decision to include the little-used guard on the postseason roster: \"[He is] a real good team player, a good locker-room kid and is a gym rat. So I opted to go with that. There are so many skills that are important in basketball, but hustling and aggressiveness and defense and all those things, which Ty Lue has, come to the forefront.\" Tyronn Lue Takes OverNBA TV's Sekou Smith discusses the new head coach in Cleveland, Tyronn Lue. All those things are what Lue has been stressing lately to the Cavaliers, who have the pedigree without the actual championship degree. In the meantime, he has what his mentor Rivers called the \"toughest job in the NBA: coaching .\"  Rivers and Lue had overlapped in Orlando for all of 11 games in 2003-04 before Rivers was fired, but from that brief time and the training camp/preseason that went with it, Rivers saw a spark in Lue that proved prophetic. He told Lue if he ever wanted to try his hand at coaching to give him a call.  Somewhat to Rivers' surprise, in the months immediately after Lue's playing days were over in 2009, that's exactly what he did. In Boston by then with a full staff, Rivers and team president Danny Ainge created a position for Lue and never regretted it. The phrase \"like a sponge\" describes perfectly how earnestly the then-32-year-old .  After four seasons in Boston and another next to Rivers with the Clippers, Lue was a finalist for the open spot in Cleveland when Blatt was hired. The Cavs were impressed enough to hire Lue as well, making him Blatt's associate and, with a reported four-year, $6.5 million contract, the NBA's highest paid assistant.  Lue oversaw the Cavs' defense under Blatt and got some attention when fans and critics noticed how comfortable Cleveland players seemed in talking on the bench and in huddles with him vs. the head coach. In pivotal Game 4 of the East semifinals series against Chicago, , keeping alive what became a victory.  Cavaliers veteran  told ESPN.com recently: \"He's extremely detail-oriented. He can tell you anything and everything about every player he played against. He's perceptive. And I think that's why he was able to be successful in all the various situations he was in. Good teams, bad teams, leadership role, major minutes, support [role], as an assistant coach and as an associate head coach.\"    Sufficiently humble without being shy, Lue has felt ready for his current opportunity for a couple years. Even some who didn't know him seemed to agree. Lue Installs ChangesNBA TV's Leigh Ellis talks with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and head coach Tyronn Lue about the changes he has installed.  For instance, Popovich only knew Lue as an opposing NBA player. But he could see the wheels turning beneath Lue's braids.  \"Absolutely,\" the Spurs coach told NBA.com. \"Obviously people thought he had it, because Doc took him on. When you're coaching, you've always got guys on your team that you know understand what's going on. And you know who cares about knowing what's going on. Some players just play and they have no interest in that sort of thing. But players who end up wanting to coach, they make it pretty obvious with the questions they ask and the knowledge they display when they play.\"  In the immediate aftermath of Blatt's firing, Popovich mocked Griffin's rationale for the move -- the Cleveland had cited the mood of the team's dressing room after games, particularly victories, as a sign that the Cavs lacked cohesion. Yet the legendary San Antonio coach didn't blame Lue for promoting himself or doing anything to undercut Blatt en route to that 30-11 record. Nor did Dallas' Rick Carlisle or Rivers, who was happy for his guy but critical of Blatt's dismissal.  The reason? Lue handled himself as Blatt's associate properly, aware of the fine line between asserting himself and usurping Blatt.  \"I love the way he's handling the whole thing, with people baiting him into comparisons with David Blatt,\" said coach and ESPN analyst P.J. Carlesimo. \"They say, 'You're doing things better' and he says, 'I was the defensive coach when David Blatt was still here.'  \"He's got a very good plan. He's been there. ... He's got a good situation because of the talent on that roster. But it's also a challenging situation because of the expectations. Coaching LeBron is a different animal.\"  Lue, in an , said: \"I know how loyal I was to Coach Blatt and the people that know me understand that. I have no control over what people think. ... To say I was doing things behind the scenes to get this job is crazy. This job? A team that's in first place? Come on.\" GameTime: Does LeBron Have The Power?The GameTime crew discusses whether or not LeBron James has the power or influence to have a coach fired. The whole LeBron/friendship connection -- James said he has been tight with Lue since he \"was 17\" -- might be an issue if other Cavalier players felt favoritism were in play. But insiders say Lue is as direct in confronting James' on breakdowns and failed decisions as he is ,  or any of them.  \"The best player in the world should sign off on any coach he plays for,\" said TNT's Chris Webber, whose five-time All-Star career overlapped with Lue's for a decade. \"But the difference with Tyronn Lue is, if you talk to guys who played against him in the league, he was respected. And it was because of his work ethic. It was because of holding guys accountable. Being in that locker room when he played was, I think you can say, akin to Brian Shaw when he was in that Lakers locker room, having a lot of coaches' duties.  \"You would think that's why LeBron respects him, because he's the same person he was on the court. A no-nonsense guy who will tell you the truth, tell you how he feels and can get his message across.\"    Lue's biggest messages to the Cavaliers so far: Play faster, pass more, defense and conditioning first and have fun.  Specifically, he has Cleveland getting James out on the break and facilitating a speedier attack, shorter on the halfcourt, isolation game it used out of necessity through injuries last spring. Irving has gotten plenty of touches to shake off remaining rust from his knee-surgery-rehab late start to 2015-16. And Lue has made it a priority to get Kevin Love the ball inside the perimeter, either in the low post or at the elbows, to fully utilize the big man's offensive repertoire.  Blatt is an excellent, accomplished coach who will work again in the NBA if he chooses. But for this team at this time -- given the awkward start and subsequent strained relationship James and Blatt had over one and a half seasons -- Lue's personality seems to mesh better. Whether his friendliness gets taken advantage of, we shall see.  \"A lot of coaches just don't know how to communicate, so therefore they don't, and it causes different problems,\" veteran guard  . \"The older you get, the more years you get, the more experience you have, it's more of a partnership.\" Some players just play and they have no interest in that sort of thing. But players who end up wanting to coach, they make it pretty obvious with the questions they ask and the knowledge they display when they play.\u2013 San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, on Tyronn Lue That's the old \"NBA players allow themselves to be coached or not\" theory. Lue didn't pass up the chance to note, when the Spurs played at Quicken Loans Arena two weeks ago, the key to that franchise's success.  \"Those guys bought in from Day 1. Tim [Duncan], [Manu] Ginobili and ,\" he said. \"When you have your top three guys buy in right away, then everybody else has to fall in line. That's kind of the thing I want to try to get here in Cleveland.\"  As for his own career move -- sliding over the proverbial 18 inches to become the boss -- Lue said: \"I was the defensive coach when Coach Blatt was here. Whenever there was a defensive breakdown or any time there was a shot that a guy scored, they'd always come to me like, 'What do we need to do? What do we need to do better?'  \"If you look at all the teams that have defensive coaches like the Clippers -- , , those guys talk to Lawrence Frank, they don't talk to Doc. I still have to be the person to get on guys when they're not doing the right thing, [same as] when I was the defensive coach. Now I think I have to be more.\"      "},

The enigmatic center has raised eyebrows around the team with some of his social-media posts, argued with the Heat stat crew during a game over his rebound total and usually isn't on the court in the final minutes of close matchups. And his most recent issue was Tuesday with him ejected for throwing an elbow in the fourth quarter against San Antonio.  \"Sometimes,\" Heat guard  said, \"we don't know what he's thinking.\"  Whatever Whiteside was thinking on Tuesday when he threw the elbow to the head of San Antonio's  isn't known. Whiteside was sent home by team officials before reporters arrived in the locker room, and the Heat won't practice again until Feb. 17. That's one day before the NBA's trade deadline, and the Heat will have to decide whether to trade him now and try to get something back or risk losing him this summer for nothing.  Getting kicked out a game again - Tuesday's was his third ejection in 93 games with the Heat - doesn't help his cause.  \"That's something that we'll deal with,\" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who wasn't hiding his displeasure.  Wade and took great pains during his postgame comments to hammer home the point that his teammates are still there for Whiteside and want to help him. They also want to be able to count on him, and that isn't always the case.  \"You can always help a guy or try to give a guy advice,\" said Heat forward , whose locker is next to Whiteside's and that means he's in his ear more than most. \"People have given me advice over my career. I think the next step for him is really learning about reputation. Unfortunately, he's taken a step back.\"  Whiteside was picked up off the NBA's scrap heap by the Heat last season, and things eventually clicked like Miami had gotten a steal. No NBA player blocked more shots in regular-season games in 2015, and he had as many triple-doubles in those 12 months as  - only five players had more. A guy who had to play in Lebanon and China when no one in the NBA wanted him seemed like he finally arrived.  And he's had some games this season that were statistically impressive. He's gotten double-figure rebounds in 29 of his 45 games, at least five blocks in 16 games, shot 70 percent or better in 15 games.  But Miami has had 23 games this season in which there's been a margin of four points or less in the last two minutes. Whiteside has played in only eight of those games, according to STATS.  \"Coach is going to make the decisions he's going to make,\" Whiteside said earlier this week. \"I can't control that. He's the coach.\"  Whiteside's talent isn't questioned. But things like complaining about calls, lobbying for a better video-game rating, a penchant for in-game pouting and of late boasting that he was driving a car that could exceed 200 mph - though he never suggested he was driving that fast and only pointed to the speedometer display during one of his Snapchat videos - are all things the Heat are surely noticing.  Some team will probably give Whiteside a big contract this summer. It just might not be Miami, and if he makes it past the trade deadline the final 29 games of the Heat season could be his final chance to impress.  \"He knows what he means to the team,\" Bosh said. \"He knows that he has to keep his head in every situation. ... He wants to win. We just have to encourage him and keep telling him what it takes to win.\"  "},

Karl said before the Kings-76ers game in Philadelphia that he and Divac are on the same page.  \"I've always felt good about Vlade. I don't think Vlade and I have a disconnect other than we want to win more games than we're winning right now,\" Karl said. \"And that's fine with me. Everyone should want to win more games.\"  Sacramento is 21-31 and has lost eight of its last nine. After Wednesday's game, Karl said the team would go home for the All-Star break to \"regroup and recuperate.\"  Divac said in a statement that Karl \"is our coach and we're collectively working through our issues.\"  He told The Associated Press before the game that the team's defense must improve. Sacramento is allowing a league-worst 109.1 points per game and has given up 120.8 over a four-game losing streak.  \"Defensively, we are not good,\" Divac said. \"That's something we have to improve big. It would make a difference. Our offense is stable, but defensively we go on and off.\"  Divac said he believes in his players, but didn't rule out adding pieces to help defensively -- or in other areas -- before next Thursday's trading deadline.  \"We do have what we need, but still like every other organization, if it's something that will improve us we will do it,\" he said. \"But, now, we are happy with the group.\"  Karl declined to offer more specifics about their meeting.  The coach said speculation about his job won't add extra pressure.  \"That's your world,\" he said. \"My world is basketball, the gym and players. Your world is interpretation, innuendo, gossip. I'm not into it.\"  Kings star  and Karl have struggled to work together. The All-Star center has not hid his emotions or frustrations.  Karl says he thinks the team's funk is temporary.  Meanwhile, he says he won't be bothered by the criticism that comes with losing.  \"When you're younger, you're always a little more into what people are saying and what people think of you,\" said the 64-year-old Karl, who is coaching his sixth NBA team after time in Cleveland, Golden State, Seattle, Milwaukee and Denver.  \"As you get older, I think you learn you have no control over that. You can do your job perfectly in this league and if you don't fulfill expectations, you're going to be criticized,\" he said.  Last year, Karl became the Kings' third coach in one season. He took over following the 2015 All-Star break, succeeding Tyrone Corbin. Corbin had been promoted from top assistant to replace the fired Michael Malone. Karl coached Sacramento to an 11-19 record for the rest of the season.  The Kings are in 10th place in the Western Conference and haven't made the playoffs in 10 years.  "},

Lillard fell just short of a place on the 2014 World Cup of Basketball roster and wasn't among the original 30 candidates for Rio de Janeiro announced last month. But he called USA Basketball Chairman Jerry Colangelo recently and said he wanted to remain involved in the program.  Colangelo said in a statement Wednesday that he and U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski feel Lillard is \"playing at a very high level\" and deserves a spot among the Olympic finalists.  The fourth-year guard is averaging career highs of 24.2 points and 7.3 assists, ranking among the top seven in the NBA in both.  He was beaten out for a guard spot by  in 2014 and cut when the Americans opted to keep Detroit's  as an extra big man on the team that won the gold medal and clinched a berth in Rio for the Americans.  Lillard will have difficulty making the Olympic team with , , ,  and  among the other point guard candidates.

It doesn't stop with Curry. The talent pool includes Cleveland's , Toronto's , Boston's , Portland's , Oklahoma City's  and the Los Angeles Clippers' , to name a few.  \"I think I'm having a career year,\" Wall said. \"I can say I'm playing my best basketball, but not the way I want to play because it's not equaling up to wins.\"  Wall is an All-Star for the third time but gets lost in the packed field of \"top-tier\" point guards. His 20.1 points a game are sixth at the position, while his 9.9 assists are third behind only Sacramento's  and Westbrook.  But some nights there is just no denying his talents.  Like Tuesday at New York's Madison Square Garden, Wall had 28 points and 17 assists to lead Washington past the Knicks. It was another showcase performance during a season that hasn't gone the way he or the Wizards have wanted.  The Wizards will be a sub-.500 team and outside the Eastern Conference playoff picture at the All-Star break. Injuries to sidekick  and many others have hampered Washington this season.  But Wall is holding up his end and is playing like a top-five point guard.  He has an all-around game - the ability to beat defenders off the dribble, to spot up, pass, use his court vision and rebound. As Celtics coach Brad Stevens said recently, \"you have to pick your poison\" when defending Wall.  \"Being able to shoot the ball off the pick and roll with great consistency - that's what makes defenses choose what to do next,\" Stevens said. \"He's been a great passer off the pick and roll.\"  There's no shortage of admiration around the league for Wall, who Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown deemed \"the fastest guard in the NBA.\" Brown compared Wall to a Maserati sports car and said the 25-year-old has improved because \"you learn how to drive your Maserati better.\"  Much of Wall's game has improved in his six pro seasons since he was the first overall pick out of Kentucky in 2010.  \"His speed is probably second to none in the NBA. ... He's a one-man fast break and it's crazy because he logs so many minutes,\" Warriors guard  said. \"His midrange jumper is also so much improved. You can tell he's been working on his game a lot, and you like to see that from guys.\"  Wall doesn't get the headlines like Curry, Irving or even Thomas, of late. He has only scored the most points in a game he's played in eight times this season, but Wall is the kind of player that teams have to game-plan against.  \"You've got to build a wall against Wall,\" Cavaliers star  said. \"You let him play in open court one-on-one, he's too fast, he's too strong. He's going to put your defense at bay.\"  Opponents have tried to close off Wall's drives to the basket and force him to take jump shots. At times, it has worked, like when the Trail Blazers limited him to 4 of 17 shooting in a victory last month.  \"When you're playing against an All-Star-caliber player like him, you work as hard as you can, you try and contain his penetration and hope he misses some jumpers,\" Portland coach Terry Stotts said.  More often than not, Wall makes the most of his time and space. Even so, Washington coach Randy Wittman believes Curry should get more recognition than Wall because of team results.  \"John's body of work has been pretty good; he's been recognized with that,\" Wittman said. \"You've got to go out and play, you've got to go out and win. Those are the two things in our league. You want recognition? Be a winner and play your butt off. That's how you get recognition, and John's gotten it.\" "},

In other news, it won't.  Any opportunity to include the assistant coaches' votes as part of getting a read on the top rookies in 2015-16 disappeared with the return of the 2015 format of the United States against the World. To fill out ballots, teams had to include four guards, four frontcourt players and two at either spot with a minimum of three rookies and three second-year players. All of that combined to make selections internationally weird.  Only three rookies made the U.S. squad: , D'Angelo Russell and Karl-Anthony Towns mostly because of the number of deserving candidates in their sophomore season rounded out the roster. The World squad, on the other hand, included six newcomers -- , Nikola Jokic, , Raul Neto,  and  as an injury replacement for  -- even though some would have trouble getting into the conversation for the 15 best rookies. (Nothing personal, Neto.)  The vote became a numbers game and a balancing act, not another layer to be factored in. Maybe guard Russell making the U.S. roster and forward  was something to be put in The Ladder equation, maybe it was a position thing.  The final Ladder heading into the All-Star break, meanwhile:    No. 1 Towns Dominates BullsKarl-Anthony Towns scores 26 points with 17 rebounds as the Timberwolves surge past the Bulls on Saturday Night. Towns has started at power forward and back at center, his original position, with  sidelined the last four games by a foot injury, but it doesn't make a difference. The rebounding tear has reached eight consecutive games in double digits, with particularly impressive numbers recently on the offensive boards. Towns is at 12.5 in that stretch and . Only one Rookie of the Year in the last 10 seasons has averaged double figures,  with 12.1 in 2010-11.    No. 2 Dunk of the Night: Kristaps PorzingisKristaps Porzingis puts his defender in the spin cycle before soaring to the basket for the slam.  While interim coach Kurt Rambis, himself a former power forward, obviously understands Porzingis' importance this season and especially to the future of the franchise, a coaching change always means uncertainty for a lot of players on their role and minutes. Porzingis was at 28.2 minutes per game at the time of Derek Fisher's firing and 31.1. the last four. The No. 4 pick still had yet to recapture the rebounding numbers from November, but remained a presence as a shot blocker, all the way to No. 1 in the class and No. 7 in the league.    No. 3 Okafor Shines vs. NetsJahlil Okafor scores 22 points and grabs 17 rebounds as the Sixers defeat the Nets 103-98. The minutes are dropping slightly, though with a steady decline in a very bad trend, and the scoring opportunities are dropping a lot. Okafor has gone from  to  to  before an encouraging, if slight, change of direction. At 13.8 points this month, and with Towns surging on offense, Okafor is in danger of not holding the top spot for the rookie scoring lead since the early days of the season. He is at 17.0, Towns at 16.7.    No. 4  Jokic has consistently been contributing three or four assists a game, small input in a lot of cases but noteworthy for centers and especially meaningful during a recent shooting slump. He is tied for seventh in the class as the highest-ranking non-point guard. If the 1.9 per outing holds, he will become just the sixth rookie center in the last 16 years to average at least 1.7 assists, joining the good company of , , ,  and Yao Ming.    No. 6 Booker Shows His Court VisionOn the break, Devin Booker throws the behind the back pass to P.J. Tucker for the reverse layup.  It took until just before the All-Star break, but Booker has finally reached the qualifying minimum to be ranked among the league leaders in 3-point shooting. He is 17th, in addition to second among rookies and along with fast-charging  of the Thunder the only first-year player better than 40 percent. That is part of his six straight games with at least 15 points before the streak ended Monday, ). Booker didn't get picked for the Rising Stars game, but  on Saturday night.    No. 5 Winslow's Big BlockJustise Winslow with a wonderful block during the second quarter. The drop was more the result of Booker's continued surge than anything Winslow did wrong. If anything, he has been solidifying his standing lately as one of the top rookies with the improved offense that has reached 56.8 percent from the field the last eight appearances, along with the big contribution of 7.9 rebounds in the same time. Winslow does not have a big scoring role with the Heat, but the shooting trend is encouraging as a complement to .    No. 7 Russell Finds BlackD'Angelo Russell finds Tarik Black with the bounce pass for the big-time slam. Talk about a nice couple weeks. The seal of approval with the Rising Stars vote has been coupled with shooting 44.4 percent the last five games, a small sample size but a positive development for someone at 41.5 percent overall. There have also been better moments as a distributor after a lot of struggles the first half of the season. Russell's new Ladder problem is that his two closest challengers for the spot are playing well enough to pass the Lakers point guard if the encouraging signs do not continue.    No. 8 George, Turner Overpower LakersPaul George records 21 points and nine rebounds, Myles Turner adds a double-double as the Pacers defeat the Lakers. Turner has not yet reached the qualifying minimum -- appearing in 70 percent of his team's games -- to be ranked among the league leaders in blocks, but his 1.43 an outing would be 18th. And with appearances in just 30 of Indiana's 52 contests because of the fractured thumb that cost him most December, that status won't come for at least a few weeks. Turner will have to be satisfied with rising to third among rookies and being one of the best in the league in the category regardless of experience the last three weeks or so.    No. 9 Johnson Scores Plus the FoulOff the miss by Jose Calderon, Brandon Jennings outlets to Stanley Johnson who finishes with the shot off the glass plus the foul. The player who has spent most of his time at small forward and has the physical tools and tenacity at 19 years old to handle real minutes at power forward in small-ball situations is now the starting shooting guard in place of the injured Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. The key development remains Johnson and his continued improvements as a shooter. He is at 45.3 percent and 12.4 points the last 11 games, the first extended contribution on offense after previously making his mark on the other side of the ball. The season-long number, though, is still 39.3 percent.    No. 10 Willie Cauley-Stein OopRajon Rondo finds Willie Cauley-Stein for the alley-oop. The Kings' latest re-emphasis on defense, this time while telling George Karl to take a few steps backward off the plank, creates more of an opportunity than before for Cauley-Stein. And he had a big role before -- 20.5 minutes a game overall but 25.6 the last five. He is fourth among rookies in blocks, sixth in rebounding, first in field-goal percentage and defending. Watch the minutes the first couple weeks back from the All-Star break. This is his chance.   none.      "},

The years in between have passed in a blur.  On his final visit to Cleveland to play against James on Wednesday night, Bryant reflected on his relationship with a player who once hung a poster of him on his bedroom wall in Akron, Ohio, and has grown into a valued friend.  And as he gets ready to say goodbye to the NBA after two decades, Bryant was stunned to learn that James, too, is on the back half of his career.  \"Is this his 10th year?\" Bryant asked, before being told that James has been in the league longer. \"Eleventh year? Thirteenth year! He's a true, true vet. It's strange. To me, it still seems like he just got into the league. Pretty crazy. ... He might retire soon, too.\"  Bryant was at ease during his interview session with reporters before the Los Angeles Lakers played the Cavaliers. This is Bryant's sendoff, his farewell tour, and the 37-year-old is trying to savor every moment.  When he was in high school and on the verge of becoming a household name, James met Bryant before playing against  in an All-Star game in Philadelphia. It was then that Bryant dropped some knowledge on James.  \"I remember sitting down and talking with him,\" Bryant said. \"The advice I gave him, because he would have so much coming at him, was focus on the game. Stay true to the craft. Everything else would sort out. That was the most important piece of advice I could give him.\"  On several occasions this season, James has spoken with reverence toward Bryant, one of the game's most celebrated players with whom he is often compared. The two didn't always have the strongest connection, but is has matured over the years, helped by them playing together on the U.S. Olympic team.  Bryant and James once seemed on a collision course to meet in the NBA Finals, but the matchup never materialized, disappointing a basketball world wanting to see the greats go head-to-head with everything on the line.  \"We never crossed paths unfortunately,\" Bryant said. \"I just wanted to win the damn thing. I didn't care who we played. For the fans it probably stinks because it would have been a great matchup, but from a player's perspective it doesn't matter who you play. ... Just want to win the championship.\"  Bryant recalled previous visits to Cleveland, including the 1997 All-Star Game when he participated in the dunk contest as a rookie. That year the showcased the game's Top 50 players, a who's who of hoops immortality that had Bryant in a daze.  \"Man, I remember walking around the hotel, I remember walking around this arena, and just running into a great after great after great after great after great,\" Bryant said. \"I grew up watching all of these players. So I watched all of the classic videos, the films, the books. So to see these players all walking around, it was pretty amazing.\"  This weekend, Bryant will take his All-Star bow. It will be the last time he mingles with his peers, who will undoubtedly honor him throughout the festivities in Toronto.  Bryant's career has come full circle.  \"I can't wait to be around them and talk to them and see how far the game has progressed, see all this young talent the different generations of players,\" said the 16-time All-Star. \"To me, LeBron is still young. I can't fathom this is his 13th season and the generations that come after him - the Durant generations, the Curry generations. There are so many generations in between that. It's going to be fun for me to be around.  \"When I first played in an All-Star game, imagine an 18-year-old, 19-year-old kid walking into a locker room and here's John Stockton with his little itty-bitty shorts. There's Barkley. There's Clyde Drexler. There's Gary Payton. I was a 19-year-kid.\" "},

He was the second player from that 2004 team honored by the Pistons this year. The Pistons retired Ben Wallace's jersey last month at a similar ceremony - in front of a packed house on a night Detroit beat Golden State.  There were some empty seats in the upper level Wednesday, but Billups wanted to be honored while the Pistons were playing the Nuggets. Billups is a Denver native and played for the Nuggets for two stints during his career.  \"This was by design, only because there's a lot of people that contributed to my success as a player and as a man, in Denver, my hometown,\" Billups said before the game. \"There were several dates that I could have chosen. This one obviously stuck out.\"  Billups does have a mild regret about his run of success with the Pistons. He figures they could have won more titles.  \"I felt like, two and maybe three championships - we were that good,\" he said.  Ben Wallace was on hand Wednesday, and so were Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace and  from the 2004 champions.

When his career ends - possibly one day soon - his name will surely be among them.  As Los Angeles Clippers forward prepared to play what may be his final game in Boston's famed Garden on Wednesday night, 15 years of memories and the idea of it maybe being his final visit here hung over \"The Truth\" as well.  \"Could be,\" Pierce said before the game. \"I'm not 100 percent sure. Like I've been saying the last two years I'm taking it year-by-year. But this could possibly be.\"  Pierce said in each of his previous visits to Boston since leaving in 2013, the feeling when he returns remains the same.  \"It's always special when I step on the Garden,\" he said. \"This has been the bulk of my career. You spend 15 years here...memories of winning a championship here. It's a special feeling. Special fans. Special building. I always savor the moments when I step on this court.\"  Pierce was given the start by Clippers coach Doc Rivers Wednesday, which resulted in a huge eruption by the Garden fans when his name was announced. Pierce acknowledged them, raising his right hand before his teammates started playfully pounding on him.  When Pierce started his career in Boston in 1998, fans thought there were getting a steal with limitless upside. Ten years later he not only fulfilled that expectation, but delivered the franchise's 17th championship as part of the Big Three tandem of , Ray Allen, himself.  After playing more than 1,100 games and scoring more than 24,000 points in his Boston tenure, he returned Wednesday for his eighth career game against the Celtics as a 38-year-old and role player on a Los Angeles Clippers team that is in the mix to challenge for another title.  He's also reunited with Rivers - his former Celtics coach - who credited Pierce with having the most impact on their title run in 2008.  \"He went through more than any of us,\" Rivers said. \"He went through tough times before I got here. We went through tough times together. Yet he's one of those guys that never asked to leave, he never wanted to bail. He stuck it out and he got rewarded for it.\"  As for his role with the Clippers, Rivers said Pierce has not only embraced the idea of being a role player, but Rivers had leaned on him to help impart wisdom that would normally fall on the coach's shoulders.  \"He gives us leadership. He gives us truth. Instead of me using my voice, I can use Paul's voice. That's been nice. It's a different team than the one here. This is a young team and a team that's trying to get over the hump. So Paul's been really good.\"  This season not only could be the final one for Pierce, but possibly for Garnett, who is 39.  \"I don't know what his plans and I don't know what I'm doing,\" Pierce said. \"But this could be the last time, who knows?\"  One thing he hasn't ruled out is coming back to Boston once he's finished playing - whenever that is.  \"I think all possibilities are open. If that is an opportunity that presents itself I would love to,\" Pierce said. \"Who knows, maybe I'll find a role here someday in the future.\"  "},

Love, whose shoulder was dislocated in last year's playoffs, left the floor in the final minute of the first half after getting his arm caught under Lakers forward 's while working in the post. Love turned toward Cleveland's bench and said \"it's my shoulder\" before heading straight to the locker room for treatment. Love's left arm hung limply to his side as he exited.  After the game, the Cavs described the injury as a contusion. Love called it a \"stinger\" and said he expects to play in the Cavs' next game after the All-Star break.  \"At the time I really didn't know what it was,\" Love said. \"It's like when you get hit in the funny bone in your elbow, it's just shooting pain. It felt like fire was running down my arm. It's just a stinger.\"  It's the same shoulder Love had dislocated in the first round of last season's playoffs when Boston center  yanked it from the socket while battling for a loose ball. Losing Love disrupted the Cavs' title chase and for a moment Wednesday night, it appeared Cleveland would be without him again.  The loss of Love in last year's first round derailed Cleveland's NBA title hopes. Still, the club signed him to a maximum contract this summer.

The Olympic Games will be played that summer in Tokyo, and by then the old contenders will be expiring. The Gasol brothers of Spain, Pau and Marc, will be 40 and 35, respectively.  of France will be 38. The stars of Argentina's greatest basketball generation -- , , Andres Nocioni -- will be retired or close to it.  The rest of the world continues to provide talent to the U.S., but those high draft picks are now being scattered among a wider variety of countries. The old powers -- Spain, Argentina and France -- are not developing reinforcements at the same high rate of previous generations. Over the last five NBA drafts, the half-dozen lottery picks that Canada has produced outnumber the combined total from Spain, Lithuania, Argentina, France, Serbia, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, Greece, Australia, Croatia, Slovenia, China, Angola, Puerto Rico, Iran, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Germany.  Those nations - No. 2 through 20 in the current FIBA world rankings -- have combined to produce as many lottery picks as Canada since 2011.  International basketball will be undergoing a transition over the next several years, and the young Canadians -- currently ranked No. 26 in the world -- appear most likely to emerge as the main challenger to the U.S. Consider this potential Canadian lineup for 2020, made up entirely of NBA first-round draft picks:   (), 29 years old    (), 29 years old    (), 25 years old    (), 26 years old    (), 28 years old  They will be coached by Jay Triano, currently an assistant with the Trail Blazers. The program will be headed by Canada Basketball GM Steve Nash, the greatest player his country has produced. Beyond the Paint: Oh Canada As the NBA takes it's All Star weekend to Canada for the first time, Matt Winer takes a look at why some of the game's best young talent is coming from north of the border and how it is affecting the fortunes of Canada's National team program. \"Steve and I talked about that when we started putting this team together,\" says Canada coach Jay Triano. \"We're too competitive to not try for this Olympics (to be held this summer in Rio de Janeiro). But the reality is those Olympics in 2020 are when our best players are going to be at their best. You reach your potential as a basketball player at 27, 28, 29 years old. They'll still have enough balance and energy, but they will be seasoned a little bit. We don't have that right now, but that's part of the process we'll be going through.\"  The Canadians . After losing the opening game to Argentina, they had won seven straight games by 25 points or more. In the semifinal, with a place in the 2016 Olympics going to the winner, they would be re-matched with Venezuela, which Canada had beaten 82-62 in the opening round. More crucial, however, was the disparity in experience: The average age of the Canadian starters was 22, while the Venezuelans were into their 30s.  \"We were rolling offensively, and we were locking teams up defensively,\" Triano says of the lead-up to . \"And I was never comfortable.\"  Apart from Olynyk, who generated 34 points and 13 rebounds, Canada sputtered long before they wasted a 75-71 lead in the final minutes. They would complain of a phantom call with three-tenths of a second remaining that would enable Venezuela to score the winning free throw, but the Canadians had already made too many mistakes to keep the game close. I think we are definitely going to be better next summer. Just having that experience together and knowing each other's games. From the top down -- coaching staff, training staff, players -- being together in situations like that just helps you get better.\u2013 Boston Celtics forward Kelly Olynyk  have experienced similar losses in big games as they learned how to win at the highest level. Will the Canadians' disappointment ultimately bring out the best in them?  \"I think we have to approach it that way,\" says Nash. \"We don't know how transformative the experience will be. We do know that we didn't have the experience to handle that moment. The moment was big for a new group like that that hadn't been in that type of situation before. You can't cheat experience. The only way to gain experience is to go through it.\"  \"I likened it to 1999 when we surprised the Argentinians in the qualifying tournament,\" says Triano. \"On that team was a young Luis Scola and a young (Francisco) Oberto and a young (Manu) Ginobili. We knocked them out of the Olympics, but that team stuck together and they were about to be very good four years later.\" 2014-15 Highlights From Canada's BestCheck out the 2014-2015 season highlights from the best Canada has to offer in the form of Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Anthony Bennett, Cory Joseph and Nik Stauskas! Argentina would go onto win silver at the 2002 FIBA World Championships in Indianapolis, and gold at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.  Canada can still earn one of the last spots in Rio by beating France and Turkey at the final qualifying tournament in the Philippines. In its favor is the fact that the best young Canadians are continuing to ascend in the NBA.

From the top down -- coaching staff, training staff, players -- being together in situations like that just helps you get better.\"  The partnership of Nash, Triano and Canada Basketball executive VP and assistant GM Rowan Barrett had its beginnings in the 2000 Olympics. Nash and Barrett were players who helped lead Canada to fourth place in Sydney, and Triano was their coach. Triano was fired, unexpectedly, in 2004, and thereafter Nash declined to play for his country. But they  when Nash was .  Triano, 57, played in two Olympics for Canada in the 1980s. He became the first Canadian native to serve as an assistant coach in the NBA when he joined the Raptors in 2002, and from 2008-11 he served as their coach. Triano also has assisted Mike Krzyzewski at USA Basketball.  \"Sometimes the losing stings enough that it brings you together, and that's part of our goal is to have our team compete this summer as well,\" says Triano. \"But if not, we get more and more experience so that we can play in the next Olympics.\"  The ultimate aim in 2020 will be to challenge the U.S. in a gold medal game. \"It's a long way away,\" says Triano. \"But I'm a believer that you have to have your long-term goals, your short-term goals, your daily goals and your practice-day goals. Why not dream for the highest and most ultimate? For our country and the growth of basketball, that might be it.\"      "},

Paco Valderrama. That driver was pronounced dead at the scene, Valderrrama said.  The Thunder issued a statement expressing \"deep sorrow\" and saying the team would support Williams \"in every way possible.\" Williams joined the Thunder this season after five seasons as the New Orleans Pelicans head coach.

So begins this story of a new world power in basketball.  Carter was the naturally-gifted shooting guard from North Carolina who would be anointed as the heir to Michael Jordan, thanks to his  one season after he had been named NBA Rookie of the Year. And that was that: Carter was going to serve as the high-flying embodiment of basketball in Toronto, whether he wanted the responsibility or not.  The job was his because of an impulsive move by the NBA, in 1995, to place two expansion franchises in Canada. The Toronto Raptors would be rescued, five years later, by their discovery of Carter. The Vancouver Grizzlies, on the other hand, would be abandoned -- evacuated in 2001 to Memphis -- ostensibly because the weakened Canadian dollar had been combined with financial losses that were inflamed by their dwindling attendances. Even so, all of those problems might have been survivable if only they'd had a star of their own. A star like Nash. Carter Reflects On 2000 Slam Dunk ContestVince Carter looks back on his 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Championship. Nash was a , on the southern end of Vancouver Island. No sooner had the Grizzlies been run out of Vancouver than Nash was being unveiled -- surprise! -- as the star who defined his region. He would play in eight All-Star Games with the Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns, win two MVP awards and serve as the quick-witted forerunner to the daring style that is being championed today by .  And so, as the new millennium was beginning to take shape some 15 years ago, there were two household names to be associated with basketball in Canada: Vince in the East, and Steve from the West.  See what was happening? See how the unforeseeable future was playing itself out? The original idea had been to create a national basketball rivalry between the franchises of Toronto and Vancouver. As soon as that plan collapsed, another more inspired dream was rising up in its stead. The new dream was based not on conflict, but rather on the emulation of Carter and Nash, who were emerging, unwittingly, as Canada's answer to Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. Of course there was no rivalry between Steve and Vince, and yet on their own terms they would become as important to Canada as Magic and Larry had been for America in the 1980s. Steve Nash: A Look BackWe take a look at the point guard's stellar career. At one end of the new Canadian spectrum hovered Carter by way of his phenomenal gifts.  From the other end 2,000 miles away came forth Nash, the star who was self-made.  One created, the other finished.  One soared above the rim, the other dribbled below it. Vince and Steve Nash were definitely the two that I could relate to the most. I could go to the games. I could see Vince Carter. It gave me something to aim for. It gave me something to dream for.\u2013 Sixers guard Nik Stauskas, who grew up near Toronto The American had been expected to be great. The Canadian, of whom nothing was expected, turned out to be even greater.  It has been 21 years since the NBA committed to expanding abroad, and all kinds of unexpected benefits are now being realized. The nation of Canada has stepped forward as the  -- which in turn has positioned the Canadian national team as a likely gold-medal challenger to USA Basketball in years to come.  Then there is the evolution of the Raptors, who, along parallel lines, , with a backcourt of  and  that on Sunday will be playing as teammates in .  Most revealing of all will be the setting of the game itself. All-Star Weekend is going to be celebrated in Toronto. Never before has the NBA held its signature event in a foreign country. More ambitious lines of expansion to Europe and beyond are still years away. But for now, this breakthrough internationally is not to be taken for granted. First things first.  \"While we're not crossing the ocean, it is a first important step to play this marquee game outside of the States,\" says NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \"And that is a very symbolic move for the league.\"  The dream of starting up franchises in the Old World remains as intimidating as ever. And yet this unprecedented All-Star Weekend is likely to embolden Silver to keep dreaming big, based on the unanticipated progression and outcomes that have followed the NBA's first small step of expansion just over the border. No one was forecasting two decades ago that the founding fathers of the new Canadian era would be Carter and Nash -- much less that each would stake out his own end of a marketplace that would stretch from East to West, with a world of opportunities emerging in between.   \"I remember exactly the spot I used to sit in,\" says , the 24-year-old big man of the Cleveland Cavaliers. \"It was literally in the back corner, way up there.\"  Each time he returns home to Toronto, Thompson wanders over to a corner of the court and looks up to where he used to be. The dream, as he remembers it clearly, was to make his way down to where he is today.  \"I was so high up to where everyone looked like little ants,\" he says. \"I was 10 or 11 years old. We had our $15 tickets to the Sprite Zone. They would give you a free hot dog and a Sprite. My dad was a construction worker, and we would usually go to one of the Tuesday games. My dad got off work early on Tuesdays so we were able to take the train downtown.\" Inside Stuff: Tristan ThompsonTristan Thompson explains why his favorite basketball player is Vince Carter. Before the arrival of the Raptors and Grizzlies, there was no high-level college or professional basketball being played in Canada. The Toronto Huskies had been members in 1946-47 in the Basketball Association of America, but they folded two years before the merger of the BAA with the National Basketball League that gave birth to the NBA.  For almost a half-century there had been little to nothing in Canada, the birthplace of the game's inventor James Naismith. Now, as Thompson grew up, there was everything.  \"Every fast break, Vince Carter would give us a windmill,\" Thompson says. \"I remember there was a concourse where you could shoot hoops, and a 50-50 raffle for the chance to win something. I just wanted a chance to get a jersey or get a handshake or a 'Hello, Tristan' from one of the players. That was like my dream come true. I was hoping, but I never won.\"  One day he and his friends saw  of the Raptors across the street in Toronto.  \"We called him 'the Red Rocket' because he would ride the train,\" Thompson says. \"I'm yelling, like, 'Red Rocket! Let's go boy!' He had like a Subway (sandwich) in his hand or something.\"  , who also grew up in Toronto, was introduced to Carter and his young teammate Tracy McGrady at a Raptors game.  Vince Carter was  by the Golden State Warriors, but was sent to the Toronto Raptors for the No. 4 overall pick, a fellow UNC star Antawn Jamison. Once he landed in Toronto, Carter became an immediate franchise icon, winning Rookie of the Year, making five All-Star Games and becoming synonymous with the franchise -- even to this day.

He would pair with Jason Kidd, Richard Jefferson and others to form a high-flying squad that remained in the Eastern Conference playoff mix, but was never a serious championship contender again.

NBAE via Getty Images  Thursday, January 28, 2016  On June 25, 2009, the Magic were looking to upgrade a squad fresh off a Finals apperance. Carter, a native Floridian and former prep star in Daytona Beach, was dealt to Orlando after 4\u00bd seasons in New Jersey. There, he teamed with Dwight Howard and helped the Magic amass 59 wins. However, the season ended in disappointment for Carter and Orlando as its Finals dreams were dashed in the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics.  NBAE via Getty Images  Thursday, January 28, 2016  Carter played only 22 games with the Magic in 2010-11 before he was dealt to the Phoenix Suns. Much like in his days in New Jersey, Carter was paired with another top-notch point guard (Steve Nash). He had plenty of memorable dunks and plays throughout that season, but the Suns sputtered to a 40-42 finish and missed the playoffs.  NBAE via Getty Images  Thursday, January 28, 2016  Carter was waived by the Suns before the start of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season. It only took three days for him to find a new squad -- the Dallas Mavericks -- as a free agent. He was an integral part of two playoff teams in Dallas and in the 2014 postseason, hit a game-winning, buzzer-beating 3-pointer to seal a win over the San Antonio Spurs.

NBAE via Getty Images  Thursday, January 28, 2016   Saturday, April 26, 2014  A free agent once again in the summer of 2014, Carter found a spot on the Memphis Grizzlies as a veteran voice and scorer off the bench. He has been with the team since then and, at times, shown he can still throw down a monstrous jam as he did in his younger heyday.  NBAE via Getty Images  Thursday, January 28, 2016  Monday, December 22, 2014    Saturday, January 31, 2015  \"You can be inspired if you watch the games,\" says Joseph, 24, who helped the Spurs win the 2014 NBA Finals before signing last summer as a backup point guard with the Raptors. \"But to see the players up close, it inspires you that much more.\"  \"My favorite players were Allen Iverson and LeBron (James) and those guys,\" says , the 22-year-old shooting guard of the 76ers who grew up near Toronto. \"But Vince and Steve Nash were definitely the two that I could relate to the most. I could go to the games. I could see Vince Carter. It gave me something to aim for. It gave me something to dream for.\"  's mother was a scorekeeper for the Raptors, which gave him access to a half-dozen or more games each season.  \"Vince, , , JYD,\" says Olynyk of the old Raptors, including . \"I watched all of the games.\"  Olynyk was 12 when his father, a renowned basketball coach who had famously cut under-aged Nash from the junior national team, moved the family to Kamloops, B.C. NBA Rooks: Olynyk On Canadian HoopsCeltics rookie Kelly Olynyk talks about growing up in Canada, joining a storied franchise and getting adjusted to life in Boston. \"I used to love Steve Nash growing up,\" said Olynyk, who now plays for the Boston Celtics. \"I loved that you had high-level basketball in your own backyard. Bringing that into Canada built an excitement around the game that wasn't there before. It was something for the kids to aspire to and look up to and dream about. You were immersed in it.\"  What do all of these young players have in common? In the last five NBA drafts, nine Canadians have been picked in the first round. More impressive is the list of a half-dozen Canadians chosen in those lotteries, including  (),  (), Thompson (), Stauskas (),  () and Olynyk (). No other country apart from the U.S. has produced more than two lottery picks in that time.  Among the nine first-rounders from Canada, eight were raised in the Toronto area. They were fans of the Raptors just as Carter was ascending. NBA Rooks: Andrew Wiggins - Pride of CanadaDraft prospect Andrew Wiggins gives an all-access look at his upbringing in Vaughan, Ontario and talks about the recent Canadian invasion into the NBA. \"I went to every game I could,\" says , the Lakers' 26 year old backup center. \"My mom and I would scrounge money up and go to games. We were up in the nosebleeds. That's what really motivated me. It just brought a surge to the city that I don't think anyone can explain.\"  Sacre, a dual citizen of the U.S., is one of the few Canadian players who was not heavily influenced by the Raptors. Born in Baton Rouge, La., he was 7 when he moved with his mother to North Vancouver. Sacre grew up cheering for the Grizzlies.   Much is made of the Canadian sense of \"insecurity\" that comes from sharing the border with the world's superpower. But the relationship works both ways. It can be oppressing, in the same way that the expectations of Michael Jordan were asking too much of Carter: At times the demands of picking up where the biggest star left off appeared to be too much for him, and so Carter insisted on proudly and stubbornly defining himself by his own terms. The Starters: Impact Of All-Star WeekendThe Starters try to describe how basketball fans in Toronto must feel to have the biggest NBA event in their city.  On the other hand, the proximity to the U.S. can also be viewed as an opportunity, a challenge, which was how Nash identified it. He was committed to fulfilling himself even though only one American university offered him a scholarship, even when he began his NBA career as the third-string point guard of the Suns, even after he was booed in his first season with the Mavericks.  As much as this golden generation of young Canadians was inspired to reach high by the airborne visuals of Carter, it was Nash's underdog mentality that they tended to emulate. They, like him, were Canadian outsiders.  \"It was definitely a huge chip on my shoulder,\" says Stauskas, who like many of his fellow Canadians chose to attend high school in the U.S. in order to hasten his basketball development. \"I remember my junior and senior year at St. Mark's (School) in Boston, I had two guys on my team that were ranked in the top 10 in the country for the class of 2012. They were great players, but I had just come over from Canada and I felt like I was already better than them. And no one knew who I was. I was never ranked. They were my friends, they were on my team, but I was like, OK, I've got something to prove. These people don't know who I am because I am from Canada. I will always have that chip on my shoulder.\"  The pathway across the U.S. border had been developed by Ro Russell, a Canadian coach who was the son of immigrants from Jamaica. \"I played hockey until I was 12,\" says Russell, 46. \"I was the only kid in the entire league that was black. So I felt out of place. I was walking home one day and I seen these kids playing basketball.\"  Russell found himself falling in love with basketball just as Magic and Bird were taking control of the NBA. His parents were entrepreneurial -- his father owned a record shop, his mother was a hairstylist -- and so was he. No sooner had Russell taught himself to play basketball than he teaching other kids in his neighborhood at a cost of 50 cents per lesson. \"That was the cost of ice cream,\" Russell says from the small office he shares at a rec center in Toronto. \"I said, I've got to get something out of this.\"  As a young adult he began putting together his own AAU teams. In America, AAU has been criticized as a destabilizing force that has weakened the traditional high school system. For the Canadians, however, there was no high-level feeder system for basketball players in high school or college. Russell viewed the AAU tournaments in the U.S. as a way for him to develop Canadian players against the best competition in America. Nash's Court VisionFew athletes had the ability to see the floor like two-time MVP Steve Nash did. The basketball authorities in Canada complained naturally that Russell was undermining their efforts to grow the sport, and he was accused of exploiting the players for his own gain. At the same time, it is difficult for anyone to escape the world of U.S. recruiting unscathed.  \"He was the first one to actually believe in us,\" says Thompson. \"Because it had never been done before. And sometimes Canadians -- some of them -- don't like to go out on a limb. They would rather play it safe and do it the conventional way. I honestly believe if it wasn't for him, I might have ended up going to some smaller Division I school.\" These kids today are stacking up against the American players a dozen times a year, and they're saying, 'Hold on a minute: I'm better than that guy. I'm playing the best kids in the States, and I know I'm better here.'\u2013 Former NBA MVP Steve Nash Russell learned the hard way. When his earliest Canadian prot\u00e9g\u00e9s failed to reach the NBA, he realized that he needed to help them become more coachable and accommodating with their teammates. He also insisted that more of his players move to the U.S. for high school -- and so Thompson spent two years at St. Benedict's Prep in Newark, to be followed by a senior year at Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nev., with his Grassroots teammate Joseph.  Another Grassroots big man, , attended the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. Powell went onto play for four years at Stanford and is now backing up  with the Dallas Mavericks. Those future NBA players -- Thompson, Joseph and Powell -- helped Grassroots became the first Canadian team to win a major summer AAU tournament in 2008.  \"When AAU became a full-blooded Canadian venture in certain quarters, it gave our top kids a chance to look eye-to-eye with their counterparts in the States and measure themselves,\" Nash says. \"I knew Jason Kidd when I was in high school, but I didn't have the chance to play against him. These kids today are stacking up against the American players a dozen times a year, and they're saying, 'Hold on a minute: I'm better than that guy. I'm playing the best kids in the States, and I know I'm better here.' \"  Today, Tony McIntyre runs a rival high-level AAU program, CIA Bounce, which has featured Wiggins and McIntyre's son , the No. 18 pick of the 2014 draft who is now playing for the Milwaukee Bucks. More programs have emerged to serve other regions of Canada. All of them are seeking to emulate the same competitive spirit that drove Nash.  \"We knew how good we could be and how good we were, and that is what fueled us to compete so hard,\" says Powell. \"We wanted to prove it because nobody else thought we were that good. But our coach told us, 'You guys can beat any of these American teams. You have just got to go and prove it.\"'  Prove it they have.   \"Some of the gyms were pretty bad,\" says Leo Rautins, a longtime broadcaster for the Raptors and former coach of the Canadian national team. \"But I was lucky. My high school, St. Michael's, was run by Basilian priests and they lived there. So if you snuck through the priests' residence, went through the cafeteria to the balcony of the gym, you could hang off the balcony. It was a three-foot drop. Once you were in the gym you could go under the stage and bring down the baskets. Then there was a side door that could get you in and out, so you could actually close up like you were never there without having to climb back up. And that was really how you had to do it.\"  Rautins was the best basketball player in Canada in the late 1970s. Close to 100 U.S. colleges were recruiting him. Among the very small minority of Canadians who knew basketball, Rautins was a celebrity. Everyone else passed by without any premonition that he was going to be a star at Minnesota and Syracuse before being  by the Philadelphia 76ers.  \"We would have guys at certain high schools, and we could say to them, 'Leave the window open a crack,' \" says Rautins, a 6-foot-8 forward whose NBA career was shortened by injuries. \"We snuck into gyms all the time. If you were part of my crew, there was always a gym or an outdoor court. There was one outdoor court in the city that was kind of famous back then, it was Keele Street schoolyard on the west side of the city. The best pickup games in the city were right there, and it was like 100 yards from my house.\" It's estimated that nearly half of Canadian kids 12-to-17 are now playing basketball. Which is remarkable, considering we're only 20 years into the country.\u2013 NBA commissioner Adam Silver These were the romantic days, when the best Canadian basketball players were trying to find their way in a country devoted to hockey. The old ideals were still in place -- the Raptors and Grizzlies were only five years old -- when Nash led Canada into the 2000 Olympic Games at Sydney. Nash, 26, and 24-year-old center  of the 76ers were the only NBA players on the team. They and their teammates bonded as never before.  \"I would go in the athletes' village and they would be sitting there playing Risk - you know, the board game?\" says Jay Triano, currently an assistant coach of the Portland Trail Blazers. In 2000, Triano was coach of the Canadian national team. He stood over their shoulders and started questioning their boardgame strategy. \"They said, 'Coach, we beat the team that we play tomorrow first -- and then we try to win the game.' So they're all converging on Australia, and once they've got Australia beat, now they compete against each other.\"  They would go 5-2 to finish fourth in Sydney. Nash was leading Canada up from the bottom in those Olympics, while Carter, the American, was leaping over Frederic Weis for his most famous dunk.    \"We had six guys on that team bring guitars, and they sat around in the village and just played their guitars,\" Triano says. \"Steve wanted to learn how to play guitar. They didn't want to get caught up in the distractions of everything else in the Olympic Games. They stayed tight and stayed together, and when one guy went to eat, 12 went to eat. It was a neat thing, and a lot of it had to do with Steve's leadership.\"  Triano was fired in 2004, surprisingly, and Nash, by no coincidence, refused to play for Canada for the remainder of his career. As much as Canadian basketball appeared to be foundering, the sport was actually developing practically out of sight. The establishment of multiculturalism as an official policy of the Canadian government in 1971 had opened the door to immigrants from all over the world, and many of them were interested in basketball.  \"Another big thing was that the internet gave our young players proximity and understanding -- they could go online and see Ray Allen's warmup or practice routine,\" says Nash. \"As a coach you could get online and find theories and best practices of the top coaches across the board.\"  Jack Armstrong, a New Yorker who has been broadcasting Raptors games for 18 years, was able to hear a change in the vocabulary of basketball. In his previous life he had been the men's basketball coach at Niagara University, which for 10 years had led him across the border to recruit Canadian players.  \"It was always hockey terminology,\" Armstrong says. \"Instead of the fast break, it was the rush out. The man advantage. Digging it out, you know. I would say 'drive it to the basket,' but a lot of people here would say 'you are driving it to the goal.' You don't hear that anymore. What you have are all these people who a generation ago were true-blue hockey people. Now their children and their grandchildren want them to sit down and watch an NBA game together. So now the older generation has gotten the bug because their kids are into it.\"  \"It's estimated that nearly half of Canadian kids 12-to-17 are now playing basketball,\" says Silver. \"Which is remarkable, considering we're only 20 years into the country.\"  Altogether now another corner is being turned. Nash, who retired as a player last season, is now . He has . The assistant GM and executive VP of Canada Basketball is Rowan Barrett, a Canadian Olympian from 2000 whose 15 year old son, Rowan Barrett Jr., a 6-foot-6 swingman at Montverde (Fla.) Academy, is already being cited as potentially the best Canadian prospect of them all.  Underdogs? The old way of viewing themselves is going to become less relevant. Beyond the Paint: Oh Canada As the NBA takes it's All Star weekend to Canada for the first time, Matt Winer takes a look at why some of the game's best young talent is coming from north of the border and how it is affecting the fortunes of Canada's National team program. \"We were always an overachieving team,\" says Rautins of the national team. \"We scrapped; we would fight every game if we had to. That was the identity. But I think the identity has changed, because it is a talent team now. The team has so much talent. Obviously you still want to be the hardest-working team. But things do shift when you are a talent team.\"   \"I see us winning 48 and 49 games the last two years, and I almost think that's like nothing, really,\" says Masai Ujiri, now in his third season as president and GM of the Raptors. \"People are so excited, and we haven't really done anything, to be honest. I don't want to discredit the players or coaches or anything. But we haven't done anything.\"  Consider those who have worked for the Raptors since their birth in 1995. Isiah Thomas, their original GM who is cheered every time he returns to the Air Canada Centre, picked ,  and McGrady in his first three drafts. His successor, Glen Grunwald, landed Carter. Former GM Bryan Colangelo was a two-time NBA Executive of the Year. Two Hall-of-Famers, coach Lenny Wilkens (2000-03) and executive Wayne Embry (since 2004) have been employed by Toronto. Even so, for most of its brief history, the organization had been incapable of getting out of its own way, as if proving itself worthy of the NBA came at the expense of winning.  That is no longer the prevailing theme. The  echoed a newfound sense of authority and confidence in Toronto. Instead of simply firing coach Dwane Casey -- because isn't that what NBA franchises are supposed to do when regimes change? -- , which in turn enabled Casey to focus on developing the hard-working, blue-collar approach that befits not only the culture of hockey, but also the mindset of this city of immigrants. NB90s: Canadian ExpansionToronto and Vancouver were awarded franchise's in the mid 1990's. When Ujiri scans the crowd at Raptors games, he sees what may be the most diverse audience in the NBA. He sees a lot of fans who relate to his own experiences as an immigrant. Ujiri was young when he moved from his native Nigeria to Bismarck State College in pursuit of his dream. That initial mission, much like the original expectations for Canadian basketball, was exceeded long ago, for Ujiri never imagined he would be in charge of an NBA franchise with so much potential. And so he has learned to recalibrate his dream, to upgrade, to think bigger than ever.  As he should, insists the commissioner.  \"The Raptors, in partnership with the league office, in essence own a country,\" Silver says. \"No other NBA team is in a similar position.\"  Not only is Toronto the No. 4 media market in North America (behind New York, Los Angeles and Chicago), but the Raptors' following extends throughout the nation with a virtual monopoly on the Canadian population of 36 million. In 2014 the Raptors rebranded themselves around a new campaign, \"We The North,\" which was meant to rally the nation around their team. By distinguishing the Raptors from the American market, the goal was to transform Canadian citizenship in the NBA from a perceived weakness into a powerful strength. The Starters: Masai Ujiri VisitsMasai Ujiri discusses the upcoming trade deadline, what the Raps are looking for, and the Giants of Africa program. In 20 full seasons Toronto has won but one playoff series -- a 2001 victory over the Knicks in Carter's third season. The current Raptors, lacking an MVP talent to contend with the likes of  and Stephen Curry, are still not positioned to win the championship. But first things first.  Lowry, a Philadelphia born-and-raised point guard who will start for the East on Sunday, . DeRozan, the All-Star shooting guard from Los Angeles, has expressed no hint of wishing to leave the only franchise he has known. Drake, the internationally acclaimed Toronto rapper, is the Raptors official \"global ambassador\" and socializes at a peer level with the NBA's biggest stars. Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, owned primarily by Canadian media giants Rogers Communications and Bell Canada, has provided chairman Larry Tanenbaum with the financial means to compete with any American franchise. They want to win. They want to win big. I just can't imagine what the country will be like if we are winning.\u2013 Raptors GM Masai Ujiri on Canadian fans \"I see this as a top-five organization in the NBA -- the city, the ownership, the fans, everything,\" says Ujiri. \"The only thing we don't have is the history of winning. All of the other boxes, I think we have them checked off.\"  The Raptors toured their extensive home market in preseason with exhibition games in Montreal, Ottawa and Vancouver. Ujiri snapped a photo of the crowd in Vancouver and texted it that night to Silver.  \"I know they wish they had a team in Vancouver, but the support for us has been amazing,\" Ujiri says. \"You could just tell in the picture I sent to Adam that it was packed with vibrant fans, and more people outside the building -- and that was a preseason game. It makes you realize the people of Canada, the people of Toronto, they are dying for a winning team. Even when I sleep I'm thinking about it. How do you put a championship team here?\" The Association: Toronto RaptorsAs Toronto prepares to face the Knicks tonight on TNT, Rick Kamla takes an all-access look at the Raptors. The goal for Ujiri is to connect his privately-held franchise to the public's ambitions for its national team. If Canada Basketball is able to rise up and challenge the U.S. in future Olympic and World Cup tournaments -- if it is able to create a rivalry with the superpower -- then the popularity of the game will transcend its old limitations. Can the Raptors, having helped ignite the development of the national team, come up with a way to tap into the new energy?  \"They want to win,\" says Ujiri of his team's fans throughout Canada. \"They want to win big. I just can't imagine what the country will be like if we are winning.\"   \"We were shooting in the practice gym, and you could hear them outside,\" says DeRozan.  He was talking about the playoffs last spring, when thousands of fans gathered in Maple Leafs Square --  -- to watch their NBA team on a big screen outside Air Canada Centre. Casey showed pictures of the crowds to his players in their locker room. Inside Stuff: Raptor FansInside Stuff captures the unique 'We The North' scene and Canadian feel of experiencing a Toronto Raptors playoff game. \"Just to understand that we have that type of fan support is definitely crazy,\" says DeRozan.  This is why this weekend in Toronto promises to be more than just another exhibition. It is going to serve as a coming-out party two decades in the making. Instead of seeking the validation of their neighbors to the south, it will be the Americans -- along with the rest of the basketball world -- who will be coming north to pay their respects to Canada.  For the first time in its 65-year history, the All-Star Game is going to be celebrated by its hosts as a patriotic event.  \"Hmmm,\" says Nash. \"I hadn't thought of it that way.\"  Welcome to the country of unexpected benefits.

Williams coached New Orleans last season, and the Pelicans also held a moment of silence for Ingrid Williams before their game Wednesday night against Utah.  The family's pastor, Dr. Mark Hitchcock of Faith Bible Church in Edmond prayed for the family.  Thunder star  was overcome with emotion as he reflected after the morning shootaround.  \"Just love Coach Monty so much, man,\" Durant said. \"I feel for him, man. It's somebody we all love.\"  Thunder coach Billy Donovan said it would be different Thursday without Williams to his right, but the team had no choice but to prepare for the game.  \"I thought our group this morning was as good as it could be coming in,\" Donovan said. \"Everybody, I think, personally, is hurting for Monty and his family. Just trying to have faith right now that Ingrid is in a better place, and hopeful that our guys will come out there and play to the best of their ability.\"  Ingrid Williams, 44, was involved in a crash Tuesday night. An oncoming car crossed the center line and hit her SUV just outside of downtown Oklahoma City, said police Capt. Paco Valderrama. That driver was pronounced dead at the scene, Valderrama said.  Monty Williams was hired by New Orleans to his first and only head coaching job in 2010 and fired after last season. He helped guide the Pelicans to the postseason twice and had a record of 173-221.  Pelicans star  spent three seasons with Williams as his coach and said Ingrid Williams was important, too. He said in a tweet: \"Completely devastated. Ingrid Williams was like a 2nd mother to me when I got to NOLA. My thoughts & prayers are with Monty & the family.\"  First-year Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said Ingrid's impact was significant. It really affected his team as it prepared for its game Wednesday night, and the players were still dealing with it Thursday.  \"It was really difficult for our guys to get through it because he (Monty Williams) has had such an impact on the players, and she had even more of an impact, maybe, with the mothering that she did for most of the guys and the type of person that she was,\" Gentry said. \"She wanted everybody to feel like they had a home away from home.\"  "},

There still would have been a traffic jam of candidates around the middle of the pack, only not stretching as far, in the number to consider and in actual miles.  The ranking of the most deserving nominees for the Hall of Fame changed dramatically in December, when officials of the Springfield, Mass., basketball museum , moving Shaquille O'Neal and Yao Ming, among others, into the debate now rather than for the Class of 2017. Or at least the partial debate since there is no uncertainty on Shaq.  O'Neal became the new most deserving, Allen Iverson, scheduled to go on the ballot for the first time in 2016 all along, dropped to No. 2, and the crowd behind them jostled for position. Tim Hardaway, Kevin Johnson, Jerry Krause and Chris Webber could all make a case to be in line ahead of the other, with Yao's candidacy receiving a big boost when he was nominated through the International committee. Not only will special weight be given to his role for China, as opposed to being a secondary layer for players in the Olympics or world championships for the United States, but Yao will now only face one round of voting while the list in the North American committee, home to the majority of NBA and NCAA possibilities, go through two ballots over several months.  The Hall will announce the finalists from North American and Women's on Friday at a downtown hotel here as part of All-Star weekend, but, in another change, will wait on the other categories. All the inductees for Sept. 9 in Springfield will be revealed April 4 at the Final Four in Houston, with interest stretching to China.  As always, this is the list of the most deserving people who have been nominated, eliminating Gregg Popovich and others, and who have NBA or ABA ties. Michigan State coach Tom Izzo, for example, is near the front of any conversation about the Hall, but strictly because of the college game.   The Hall of Fame does not release the vote totals for either round so there will be no way to know if he is elected unanimously, but O'Neal is the best case for 24-0 on the final ballot since Karl Malone in 2010 or Michael Jordan, David Robinson and John Stockton in 2009. The only knock is that Shaq could have been better if he stayed in shape. Beyond that, and the free throws, he falls in line behind few players ever and even fewer centers. His acceptance speech in September will probably be just as good. The Starters: Fill In The Blank: Allen Iverson Is A _______ Hall of Famer? Is Iverson a lock to get in? Does his cultural influence come in to play?  Moving down one place after the wait time was shortened and O'Neal took over the top spot does nothing to diminish Iverson's chances. He won't reach Springfield for being uniquely popular, as Dennis Rodman proved by failing to make it to the finalist stage his first year of eligibility, 2010. The AI candidacy is built on the very solid ground of one MVP, one Rookie of the Year, two seasons as a star at Georgetown, and four scoring titles en route to finishing at 26.7 points per game, and the intangibles as a warrior of a small guard who left pieces of himself on the court to keep playing.   He put together the Bulls championship era. Talk about impacting the history of the game. Michael Jordan was already in Chicago when Krause took over as head of basketball operations, but Krause traded for Scottie Pippen, Bill Cartwright, Dennis Rodman and Luc Longley. Krause signed Ron Harper, John Paxson, Scott Williams, Steve Kerr and Bill Wennington. Krause drafted Horace Grant, Toni Kukoc, B.J. Armstrong and Will Perdue, and Krause hired Phil Jackson as coach. Among Krause's competition in the Contributor category: his former boss, Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf.   He is sixth in career assists per game on a list where everyone else in the top seven is either in the Hall (Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Oscar Robertson and Isiah Thomas) or will be ( and Jason Kidd). KJ finished in the top five in assists in four seasons and the top 10 six times, was second-team All-NBA four times and third-team once, was a three-time All-Star, and won gold at the 1994 world championships. Voters are only supposed to weigh his playing career, but the work as mayor of his hometown to get an arena built and keep the Kings in Sacramento can't hurt.   The only member of Run TMC not enshrined -- Mitch Richmond was elected in 2014, Chris Mullin in 2011 -- made an All-NBA team five times, the All-Star team another five, and won gold in the Olympics and world championships. Hardaway was versatile enough to be a big-time scorer, even on teams in Golden State and Miami with other stars, or a talented playmaker. In a historic time in NBA history for guards, with Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, John Stockton and Gary Payton well established and Jason Kidd coming fast, Hardaway was the only other player to make first-team All-NBA.   Webber's career was routinely surrounded in controversy, from college to stops along 15 NBA seasons. But: He pretty much averaged a 20-10 (20.7 points and 9.8 rebounds) even with obvious decline the final couple years that hurt the career numbers, he was a gifted offensive player who could score from several spots and pass, a good defender, an All-American at the University of Michigan, Rookie of the Year and a five-time All-Star who was first-team All-NBA once, second-team three times and third-team once. Top 10 Career Plays: Yao MingGo back through Yao Ming's career and count down his top 10 plays in the NBA.  Yao would have had a tougher road if he went through the North American group and was judged on the NBA career filled with injury potholes. This way, there can be much greater emphasis on what he meant to the sport in China and how growing the game in the most-populous nation in the world was important to the Rockets and the entire league. A healthy Yao with longevity probably strolls into the Hall in any category. In NBA terms, though, he played eight seasons, and one of those campaigns lasted five games and another 48 games. When he was right, though, he was special.   The lethal scorer at forward with the ABA and NBA Pacers and the NBA 76ers and Nuggets averaged at least 21 points for seven consecutive seasons in the two leagues and was ABA co-MVP in 1975 while in Indiana. Imagine the scoring numbers if he hadn't played two of the seasons in the same frontcourt as Julius Erving. McGinnis averaged 17.2 points and 9.8 rebounds in seven NBA seasons. He was also a third-team All-America at the University of Indiana.   Jones returns to consideration after previously being removed from the ballot because of a lack of voter support. But he deserves a long look at the very least. He was first-team All-Defense for 10 consecutive seasons with the Nuggets and 76ers in the ABA and NBA, made five All-Star appearances in the two leagues, had an important role on Philadelphia's 1983 title team, won Olympic silver in 1972, and was a very good shooter. Jones was the epitome of understated while playing alongside offensive stars that got the spotlight.   The NBA connection is thin, but it is a connection. Galis was born and raised in New Jersey, played at Seton Hall and was drafted by the Celtics in the fourth round in 1979. After getting hurt in training camp and being cut, he went to Greece (his parent's homeland) and turned into a star. Known sometimes as Nikos Galis, he was eventually voted one of the 50 greatest players in the history of FIBA, the international governing body for basketball, was in the first class of the FIBA Hall of Fame and became the leading scorer in Euroleague history.

Bickerstaff said his team was \"broken.\"  So the response might be to break the Rockets up completely.  Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports is reporting that general manager Daryl Morey is reaching out around the league about trading center .   The 30-year-old former eight-time All-Star plans to opt out of his contract this summer to become an unrestricted free agent and will reportedly seek a maximum level new deal. With a team churning in turmoil and torpidity, neither side is willing to commit to the future and so a decision must be made by the Feb. 18 NBA trade deadline.  League executives told Yahoo Sports that Howard's agent, Dan Fegan, and the Rockets are working together on potential destinations for Howard, an eight-time All-Star who turned 30 in December.  But in a statement to ESPN on Thursday, Fegan said: \"I'm not privy to what the Rockets are doing or not doing with respect to Dwight Howard. What I can say, with 100 percent certainty, is that Dwight has not and has never asked the Rockets for a trade. And neither have I.\"  This all comes just 8 1/2 months after the Rockets used a run to the Western Conference finals to proclaim themselves as true championship contenders in 2016 and barely three months following coach Kevin McHale's firing due to a 4-7 start to the season. It's like a marriage. You might need time away to get back right. I've seen worse.\u2013 Rockets' Jason Terry on team's chemistry The Rockets, Morey said then, play to win.  Just not every night and not, on most, nights for all four quarters. Things had gotten so bad that after a pair of recent games \u2014 a win at lowly Phoenix and a home thumping by Portland \u2014 when they fell behind big with lackadaisical starts, Bickerstaff sang his team's praises for not leaving the arena at halftime. \"Scrappiness,\" he called it.  But after Wednesday in Portland, it became clear that the only thing the Rockets are scrapping is the bottom of their barrel of credibility.  To trade Howard now would mean Morey has to give up on his fantasy pairing of the big man he chased for years with All-Star guard . It also would mean changing his pitch to headline free agent  in July. The plan had been to offer K.D. a chance to complete a Big Three with Howard and Harden that would vault the Rockets right into the elite contenders, then go back afterward and re-sign Howard to a new deal. Without Howard in the middle, it's hard to see how a chance to reunite with Harden would be anymore appealing to Durant than staying in Oklahoma City with .  \"Where we're at shifts how much you focus on now versus future,\" Morey told Jonathan Feigen of the . \"Doesn't make you exclusively look at one versus the other.\"  For the Rockets to unload Howard means they would have to take back $17 million in salaries and find a partner willing to embrace the knowledge that the big man will most certainly opt to become a free agent in 4 1/2 months.  Assuming that could be done, it still doesn't solve the other big problem \u2014 the Rockets' lack of direction and purpose.  Firing McHale was the quick and easy move back in November for an organization built on analytics that weren't adding up to enough wins in the short term. But the truth is the bad defense and sloppy offense that the Rockets brought into the season was more a reflection on the players.  For three seasons with Harden and Howard, the Rockets have lacked leadership on the court and are not seen by opponents as a team that works hard. Both want the perks and trappings of being the big dog pulling the wagon, but neither will do the real work. Howard smiles and says everybody should keep positive thoughts. Harden shrugs his head and goes back to seeking his next 40-point game.  Howard and Harden have been an oil-and-water mix since they came together for the 2012-13 season. It was only days after 's 3-point dagger eliminated them in the first round of their first playoff series together when both were sending out messages and maneuvering to get the other one traded.  Harden is a difficult teammate to play with, dominating the ball and so much of every shot clock and Howard too often felt ignored. The solution was supposed to be the addition of  at point guard this season to take the ball out of Harden's hands. But that combination never worked from the start and steadily the Rockets have come unraveled.  It also didn't help that Harden says a sprained ankle over the summer prevented him from reporting to training camp in shape. Then when McHale was sliding toward the cliff, Harden all but nudged him over the edge with his uninspired play.  \"If you look at it, the chemistry is not quite where you would like it, and hopefully the break can be what we need to get away from each other,\" veteran reserve guard  said after the bottom fell out in Portland. \"It's like a marriage. You might need time away to get back right. I've seen worse.  \"Genuinely do we like to play with each other? That's as simple as I can get it; X's and O's take care of itself. We're talking about basketball, and if you can't get five guys on the court that can function as a unit you're not going to have much success.\"  That's often when one of them has to go.      "},

He was too much in shock, understandably, and if anything he immediately worried about his parents and their thoughts. Please don't take that personally, but their voices were inside his head and their hands were by his side once the medication wore off a bit in the emergency room and he realized what exactly happened.

The only question in my mind was when, not if. When.\" USAB Scrimmage RecapPaul George was carried off on a stretcher after suffering a gruesome leg injury Friday night. Each time George takes the floor for a Pacers' game, the same scene is replayed. He gets hugs at mid-court from players on the other team, and also by the other coaching staff. Before the game, whenever the Pacers are on the road, there are area staff members who greet him, shake his hand. And the fans ... everyone, it seems, is a Paul George fan these days. The love he gets, from people 'Who Remember What Happened', is constant.  \"Man,\" he says, shaking his head. \"It's overwhelming, to know how much it means for people to see me back on the floor and playing at a high level. And I appreciate everyone. It means so much.\"  But the gushing he gets now doesn't compare to what happened in the immediate aftermath of his injury. It showed the power of sports, of compassion, of faith and of social media. Everyone with a computer, it seems, reached out to George in some way or form. Twitter was flooded with mentions, and in particular, famous folks connected to him through the web-a-sphere. He was floored by that.  \"I mean, a bunch of people through the entertainment world, people I didn't really know or only met once, people whose work I admired from when I was a kid,\" he said. It's really remarkable that he's even back on the basketball court and playing like the old Paul George.To overcome something like that and go through all the rehab is a great accomplishment.\u2013 Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel How about some names?  George thinks for a moment?  \"I heard from a lot but the one who stands out at the moment is David Beckham,\" said George. \"He and his wife (former Spice girl Victoria Bekham) called me and expressed their concern and support. I was like, wow. Thanks.\"  George had a rod placed in his shin during surgery, which was followed by months of physical therapy to help strengthen the leg. Because the injury involved bone and not muscle or tendons, George was encouraged that his recovery wouldn't be as drastic as he originally thought. By comparison,  broke his leg and suffered ligament damage several years ago, and it took him roughly two years to recover. Climbing the Mountain - Episode 1See how Paul George, Shaun Livingston and Jamal Crawford all battled injury but never gave up on their NBA dreams. Before the injury, George was a tough on-ball defender with length and a strong rebounder for a graceful, 6-foot-9 small forward. He doubled as a prime scoring option who could shoot with range and attack the rim. Those all-around skills separated him from most. He averaged 21.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.9 steals in 2013-14 which earned him a spot on Team USA, which justified his position as a top-10 player.  Now, compare that to his first five weeks of this season, when he averaged 29.3 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists. Those numbers have dropped a bit since, but George's averages for the season (23 points, 7.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists) puts him currently at the pace he was pre-injury.  He gives some credit to his abbreviated return last season, seven months after surgery, when he played six games and averaged 15 minutes.  \"That helped me get a sense of where I was and where I had to go,\" he said. \"It gave me a bit more confidence going into that summer.\"  Pacers coach Frank Vogel saw the way George played with a slight limp in those six games and wondered, but any worries quickly disappeared when training camp began and Vogel recognized the player from two years earlier. I mean, it's not like this kind of thing happens every day or every year. You just don't see it. But after I had the chance to understand what happened and not too long after surgery and speaking to the doctors, I knew I'd be back to this point. The only question in my mind was when, not if. When.\u2013 Indiana Pacers All-Star swingman Paul George \"It's really remarkable that he's even back on the basketball court and playing like the old Paul George,\" he said. \"To overcome something like that and go through all the rehab is a great accomplishment. To see him play this way makes it more special.\"  Vogel adds: \"When the doctors told him the surgery was successful, that's all he needed to hear. In his mind, he was going to get back to where he was before and do whatever necessary to accomplish that.\"  The Pacers are a different team than the one George knew and helped battle the -led Heat in the East.  and  are gone and the team is in transition, although not worthy of a tear-down. There's an enthusiasm about rookie , while guard C.J. Miles has been a pleasant surprise, yet the Pacers are currently in the bottom half of the playoff draw. George is their only solid star and he's only 25, so there's time, but he has learned not to take anything for granted.  \"I think I'm back to where I needed to be,\" he said, \"and now my goal is to get this team back there as well. I like where we are as a group. Obviously we need to improve in a few areas, but I have confidence in the organization that we'll get there.  \"I'm the last person to be pessimistic about anything.\"  Two Januarys ago George unleashed a 360 windmill slam against the Clippers, one of the best in-game dunks in recent NBA history if not all time. That of course was before the broken leg. Can he repeat that feat? He laughed and winked.

And even though Bryant hasn't been the consistently dynamic player he once was while playing for a Los Angeles Lakers team that is losing games by the bucketful, O'Neal couldn't help but be a little envious of the way Bryant has been able to say goodbye.  O'Neal's stellar career came to an end because of injury, robbing him of the chance to have the same kind of ending that Bryant is getting.  \"I wish I would've had a Shaq Tour, yeah,\" O'Neal said Thursday before co-hosting TNT's popular \"Inside The NBA\" show that helped kickoff the league's All-Star festivities in Toronto. \"Definitely. I know it would've been a lot of fun. I know I would've got a lot of gifts. It happened the way it happened. You can't complain. Just gotta move on from it.\"  O'Neal suffered a torn Achilles in 2011 while playing with the Boston Celtics at the age of 37. The most dominant big man of the modern era said he planned to play one more season before the injury and he was going to spend the summer of 2011 setting up his farewell tour to make it a goodbye as big as the man himself.  Once he went down, though, he knew it was over. He averaged 9.2 points and 4.8 rebounds in 37 games of his final season. The Celtics offered to help him through rehab to make one more go of it, but O'Neal wouldn't have it.  \"For me, it didn't feel right averaging 27 and then being a role player averaging 10,\" O'Neal said. \"I didn't feel like Shaq anymore. So I was like, `you know what, I'm going to just go and chill and relax.\"  Bryant is on center stage this weekend after getting voted into the game as a starter on the Western Conference team. The two won three championships together in their famously combustible relationship that ended with O'Neal getting traded to Miami in 2004.  \"They're not competitive,\" O'Neal said about Bryant's Lakers, who have the second-worst record in the league at 11-44. \"This year is all about the Kobe tour. He's showing his obligation to the fans, giving him one last chance to look at him. I commend him for that.\"  On Friday, O'Neal could be selected as a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.  With former Lakers center 's name popping up in trade rumors earlier Thursday, O'Neal didn't miss a chance to tweak a player he has often criticized in the past. The Rockets are struggling and in ninth place in the Western Conference, but Howard's representatives issued a statement through ESPN saying their client wants to stay in Houston and make it work.  \"(The Rockets) are not happy with him and I'm not happy with him either,\" O'Neal said. \"Every time I talk about him, people think it's hating, but it's not. And he's not getting double-teamed. I wish a (team) didn't double me. He doesn't get doubled at all.\"  "},

Craig Sager, the TNT sideline reporter known for wearing flashy suits, missed the NBA's annual midseason gala for the first time since he started doing them in 1988. Another bout with the leukemia he's been battling for the last few years resurfaced, and Sager was forced to sit out while undergoing more treatments.  Sager considers the All-Star festivities the most important weekend of the season for him, and so it pained him to have to watch on television while receiving his treatments.  \"It was hard for me not to be there, but I had to address my health,\" Sager said. \"To be able to get that in remission and be able to go through this year, it's going to be extra special for me. I've really been looking forward to this a long time.\"  That's right. Sager is back for All-Star weekend in Toronto this year.  He spent the week leading up to it in Houston receiving his monthly treatment, which included a blood transfusion, to make sure he was healthy enough for the trip. Once he arrived in Canada, he was easy to spot.  \"I just saw him,\" Spurs coach and longtime foil Gregg Popovich said after the Western Conference team practiced on Saturday. \"His suit spoke to me. It blinded me for a second.\"  It's been an emotional run for Sager, the longtime fixture at NBA games. He has needed two bone marrow transplants and still has to make those treks to Houston once a month. He has returned to the sideline for games this season and is feeling so well that he was scheduled to do both the Saturday night activities that include the 3-point shootout and the dunk contest as well as the game on Sunday.  \"I feel great. Got my weight back. Got my strength back,\" Sager said. \"I'm back to playing golf.\"  Two of his youngest children -- daughter Riley and son Ryan -- will be with him on the court this weekend serving as a ball boy and ball girl.  And of course, Sager will do a round with Popovich on television during a quarter break on Sunday. The two have turned the sideline interview into a passion play,  \"He's been an iconic figure in the NBA. He does a great job,\" Popovich said. \"His sense of humor is obvious. we have a lot of fun going back and forth with that. To have him back where he belongs, obviously we're happy for him and his health. But for the league it's great too, because he's a fixture that everybody enjoys.\"  Sager called the support he has received from Commissioner Adam Silver, coaches, players and fans \"humbling\" and said he was looking forward to coming back to his favorite event of the season.  \"It's been very uplifting, very therapeutic,\" Sager said. \"Very supportive on their part. That really has been very helpful to me, my treatment and my drive to get back.\" "},

It must be time to play the  again, the fourth running of the revised game that essentially squeezed true centers out of the mix. When the East and West players touch fists on Sunday at the Air Canada Centre and gather around the mid-court circle for the tip, it will likely be  vs.  for the jump ball. Or if coaches Gregg Popovich and Tyronn Lue had a sense of humor, they'd put Steph Curry against .  We do know for sure it won't be  against , a more natural pairing. Both will be on the bench and watching and feeling a bit jealous that, had this been 2012, they'd have the honors. But a league committee decided that All-Star starting lineups would feature three front-court players regardless of position, rather than keeping the designated one center. If that policy change caused an uproar among elite centers, you certainly didn't hear it, because there weren't that many elite centers at the time.  But now?  \"It's wrong,\" said Cousins. All-Star Top 10: DeMarcus CousinsCheck out the top 10 plays from Western Conference All-Star DeMarcus Cousins! \"I wouldn't mind going back to the way it was before,\" said Drummond.  You can certainly understand why the league was moved to do this. The game was (and still is) going small, and teams are sticking 6-foot-9 power forwards in the pivot and playing a more up-tempo style. And because this approach is being embraced by the Warriors and , who's making his first All-Star appearance by primarily playing center, the trend will likely continue.  For some reason, mothers and fathers today are producing fewer seven-foot sons with wide bodies who are capable of controlling the paint. The prototype is becoming rare, and most true centers in the league right now are rather clumsy and unskilled and mainly set picks and try to master the big-man duties of rebounding and blocking shots.  Also, the league grew weary of  taking an All-Star spot away from others. For years the Spurs listed Duncan as a forward, even though he primarily played center. Meanwhile, centers of average ability were showing up on All-Star rosters and nobody wanted to see them on the floor in an exhibition game that's best played by creative players.  Stu Jackson, then a league executive, explained: \"Having a center is the only specific position that was singled out on the ballot. It just seemed a little outdated and didn't represent the way our game has evolved.\" All-Star Media Day: DeMarcus CousinsKings' 2-time All-Star DeMarcus Cousins sits with TNT's David Aldridge in Toronto. Jackson denied that centers were being discriminated against and, in fact, if two centers would good and popular enough, then the starting front-court would be two centers and one forward. But nobody could envision that at the time, when it was tough to find two elite centers in the game, let alone in the same conference.  The real reason for the change was the development of the modern player. Suddenly, it became advantageous to put a quicker and more athletic \"big\" man at center than a lumbering oaf, and so teams adopted that idea and minimized the importance of the once-typical center.  But did the league act too quickly to punish centers and reward a trend that could someday flip back to favoring centers?  \"You shouldn't disrespect the center position the way they're doing,\" said Cousins. \"We work as hard as the other positions. I think the center position is very much alive.\"  Cousins could have a point. He's only 25 and is averaging 26.8 points and 11 rebounds, top-five in both, and this season has added a surprisingly reliable three-point shot. It's a new generation in the game and everybody wants to see small lineups, but with time, a lot of new blood will bring change ... I think the giants will come back.\u2013 Andre Drummond Drummond is even younger at 22 and is yanking rebounds at a rate not seen among centers since Wilt. Karl-Anthony Towns might be the front-runner for Rookie of the Year. These three, assuming good health, should have multiple All-Star-worthy years in their future between them.  \"On behalf of the other centers, it shouldn't be that way,\" said Cousins. \"But it's a trendy league. That's what's trending right now, the small-ball stuff, and I'm sure it'll change down the road. A lot of great talent coming up.\"  In the first year of the revised voting,  was the only starting center. In 2014, there was no true center in the lineup. Last season,  was the only natural center, although his brother Pau, who split time that season between center and forward for the Bulls, did start for the East.

I think the giants will come back.\"  The league has given no indication that it's ready to pull a reversal. The only way centers can be represented in the starting lineup, and on rosters period, is to elevate their game and do it in bigger numbers.  \"All I can do is play hard,\" Drummond said. \"What the fans choose for their starters, it's up to them. For our team in Detroit, we have a good lineup and we use our centers. We haven't followed the trend, and I'm thankful for that. My team and my organization gave me a chance to grow and improve.\"      "},

The Minnesota Timberwolves rookie center beat Boston Celtics point guard  to win the Skills Challenge on Saturday night, further validating the evolution of the big man from a plodding post player to a playmaking force.  In the first year that frontcourt players were allowed to compete against the guards in the event that puts a premium on ball-handling, passing and perimeter shooting, Towns beat Golden State's  and Sacramento's  in the big men side of the bracket before edging Thomas in the finals.  \"I'm glad I was able to help the bigs come out with this trophy,\" said Towns, the No. 1 overall pick in the June draft. \"This is bigger than me. This is for all the bigs out there, with the game changing the way it is, to show that bigs can stand up with guards and skillwise.\"  It's been four years since the NBA decided to eliminate the center position on the All-Star ballot in response to the dearth of talent at the position and the evolution of the game from post-centric offenses to pace and space.  With his ability to handle the ball, shoot the 3 and make the extra pass, Towns is the epitome of the improving big man. But heading into the competition, there were doubts that the big fellas could keep up with the small fries. Even Towns' teammate, point guard , joked last week that he had no chance.  \"I like proving people wrong, so I'm glad I was able to make a lot of people wrong,\" Towns said. \"I was able to make critics wrong, Vegas wrong, Ricky Rubio wrong. So I'm just so ecstatic right now.\"  The course required players to weave through some obstacles, throw a pass through a target, dribble the length of the court for a layup and then make a 3-pointer.

Thompson finished the final round with 27 points, four more than Curry managed as once again, the title came down to the two Golden State sharpshooters.  \"We love to shoot against each other,\" Thompson said. \"You know, I've never been on a team with someone who shoots it better than me, so it's a privilege to work with him every day. He makes me that much better.\"  Phoenix's  was third, with 16 points in the final round. He beat Houston's  and J.J. Redick of the Los Angeles Clippers to get out of the first round, and Toronto's , Portland's C.J. McCollum and Milwaukee's  were eliminated early.  As probably many expected, it came down to Curry and Thompson.  Curry shot before Thompson in the final round, making his first seven shots and putting up 23 points - which, to that point, was the best score of the night. Shooters got one point for making a conventional 3-pointer, two points for using a multicolored \"money ball.\"  \"At the end of the day, you've got to make shots,\" Curry said. \"Just like in a game.\"  So the pressure was on Thompson, and he delivered.  Here's how good Thompson was in the finals - he had two different streaks of eight consecutive makes. Thompson was 19-for-25 in the final round, 18-for-25 in the first, and adding them together put him at 74 percent on the night.  That's what it took to beat Curry, who set the NBA single-season record with 286 3-pointers last season and is on pace to obliterate that mark this season. He's already at 245, and the Warriors have 30 games remaining.  And really, the only title Curry probably really wants to defend is the NBA championship anyway. He and Thompson have helped the Warriors get off to a 48-4 start this season, making them the heavy favorites to repeat as titlists.  \"Back-to-back years for the `Splash Brothers,\"' Thompson said. \"It's pretty cool.\"  "},
{"url": "http://www.nba.com/2016/news/02/13/silver-wrestling-with-hacking-conundrum.ap/index.html", "text": "  \u2014 Adam Silver said Saturday no changes are coming to Hack-a-Shaq this season, though he seems to favor some rule adjustment.  And with no consensus within the NBA about what it would entail, the NBA commissioner seems to be taking it upon himself to come up with something.  \"So I think it's my job right now to at least formulate an alternative together with the competition committee to ultimately bring to our board of governors,\" Silver said Saturday night during his annual All-Star press conference.  Silver said the strategy of intentionally fouling poor shooters away from the ball has increased this season, which has caused him to rethink his stance.  \"As I said last summer, I said I was personally on the fence as well. I'm beginning to feel that a change needs to be made. And that comes in response to conversations with our network partners. It comes in response to fan data that we look at. We're constantly surveying our fans to get their sense of what they see out on the floor. I'm talking to players and general managers, and our owners of course.\"  Change would be difficult, because though some coaches say they hate using the strategy, they clearly believe it can be effective. Silver said league data shows it is being used at a 5 1/2 times greater rate than last season.  Mostly used on Shaquille O'Neal when he played, coaches now find Houston's , Detroit's  and the Clippers'  to be targets. And though it slows the game and has drawn more criticism this season as techniques such as jumping on a player's back during a free throw or fouling an inbounds passer have increased, nobody seems to have a good solution.  Silver said a rule change would require approval by 20 of the league's 30 teams.  \"So we're nowhere near that point where we're even starting to count heads,\" Silver said. \"And I think there is a reason when the constitution and bylaws were written of the NBA that those founders decided that it should take two-thirds of teams to change a rule. I think it should be a very deliberate process, you know, and nothing should be done harshly, which is why I'm not in favor of changing the rule midseason.\"  So he believes owners will consider it at their April meeting with the hope of having something to vote on during their July meeting.  Silver began his remarks on a somber note by sending his condolences to Oklahoma City assistant coach Monty Williams and his five children. Williams' wife, Ingrid, was killed this week after a car accident.  He praised Toronto as host of the NBA's first All-Star Game not in the U.S. despite its frigid temperatures, joking that the events are indoors. He said the league is always trying to take its game to Europe, but that it remains difficult without further changes to the schedule.  \"Now, having said that, one of the things that we're continuing to talk to the Players Association about is the length of the season, the length of the preseason, when it is we should start the league, when it is that we should ultimately finish and get the draft in,\" Silver said.  \"So having an All-Star Game internationally has to be part of those larger discussions. It's something we'd love to do one day. It's not going to happen in the next two, three, four years, but I think down the road it could be a really exciting element for the NBA.\"  Next year's All-Star Game is in Charlotte, North Carolina. No plans are set beyond that.  Silver added he wanted to see the draft remain in June.  "},
{"url": "http://www.nba.com/2016/news/features/steve_aschburner/02/13/adam-silver-news-conference-021316/index.html", "text": "  \u2014 If the Hack-A-Whomever strategy currently raising such a ruckus in some NBA precincts is actually something you like, take solace: It's going to be with us, extending the real time of games, disrupting any sense of flow and showcasing a whole lot of bricked free throws, at least through the end of the 2016 playoffs.  If, though, you believe in the tactic as a coach's best friend -- something to encourage bad foul shooters to improve, lest they look silly and cost their teams victories -- those guys had better get in the gym soon and practice their form, release and follow-through fast.  Change almost certainly is coming, based on NBA commissioner Adam Silver's comments Saturday in the annual state-of-the-league All-Star news conference.  Silver, addressing and fielding questions from reporters before the skills, slam dunk and 3-point shooting contests at Air Canada Centre, reiterated what he has said on several recent occasion. \"I'm beginning to feel that a change needs to be made,\" Silver said, citing conversations he has had with broadcast partners, sentiment expressed in fan data and feedback from players, GMs and owners.  As for coaches, Silver said \"Clearly our coaches who are smart and using very complex analytics believe it is benefiting them.\"  But changing the rules wouldn't be pursued to make life tougher on the league's coaches, any more than it would be done to let the most frequent targets of the tactic -- notoriously poor free-throw shooters such as  (.423 free-throw percentage),  (.351),  (.532) and a handful of others -- off the hook. It would be a decision driven more by the NBA product as entertainment, not merely athletic competition.  Silver did share that, when the league's competition committee discussed the strategy last summer, it sought data from an additional season before making a recommendation. That data so far? \"We're seeing the Hack-a-Shaq strategy used at roughly a five-and-a-half-times greater rate than it was used last season,\" the commissioner reported.  That's a lot of standing around, stoppages in play and, for folks viewing from the stands or on TV at home, a procession of finely tuned, multi-millionaire athletes failing at one of basketball's fundamental skills. That's not a good look for anyone involved.  Interestingly, Silver said that there is no consensus among the practice's critics what remedy should be pursued. Treat the entire game like the final two minutes, when fouls away from the play equal one free throw and retained possession? Come up with something more stringent to snuff even the temptation to hack a targeted player intentionally?  Silver said he would want to have a specific alternative to propose. And even then, that sort of change would need the approval of two-thirds of the league's members (20 of the 30 teams).  \"So we're nowhere near that point where we're even starting to count heads,\" Silver said. This summer would be the soonest, he indicated.  Among other topics Silver discussed:  -- The experience so far through the first All-Star Weekend staged outside the United States' borders had been positive enough that, at some point in the future, another foreign market might be explored. Silver mentioned Mexico City, since it wouldn't require the extensive travel that some overseas markets would. But nothing international in the next three or four years is likely. The 2017 All-Star Game will be held in Charlotte.  -- , participating in his final All-Star experience -- and a heavy favorite to wind up as Most Valuable Player in Sunday's game, as much as that can be orchestrated by his fellow All-Stars -- will be missed beyond the skills and thrills he brought to the annual event. Silver said of Bryant: \"In addition to being a great player, I think because he was raised for much of his childhood in Italy, because he speaks several languages, I think because he was particularly interested in learning about other cultures, I think ... he's punched way above his weight in terms of the impact he's had on the global expansion of the NBA.\"  -- There is no active discussion of further tweaking the postseason seeding, such as a straight 1-through-16 system without regard to conference affiliation. The travel concerns for certain early-round matchups and the NBA's lack of a balanced schedule still argue against it, the commissioner said.  -- Silver acknowledged there will be \"unintended consequences\" when the first gush of the NBA's new nine-year, $24 billion TV revenue hits the system this summer, boosting the salary cap from $70 million per team to a projected $89 million. But he didn't address specific speculation about stars clustering on the same rosters, a la the Miami Heat in 2010. The current hot topic involves Oklahoma City All-Star  potentially ganging up with the Golden State Warriors on the unfortunates of the league.  Silver did mention a couple times the lessening role market size can play, if teams in smaller cities have the funds to pay players and enough popularity to further their \"brands.\" Said Silver: \"Ultimately what that system is about is player distribution. So if you look now at the league, we see the way our stars are distributed throughout the league. You see seemingly no correlation between market size and where the stars are located.\"  -- Expanding the D-League to 30 teams, enabling a 1-for-1 affiliation system with NBA franchises, is a priority the NBA hopes to fast-track.  -- Silver began his news conference on a somber note, offering condolences to Oklahoma City assistant coach Monty Williams and his five children for the tragic death of wife and mother Ingrid Williams, 44. She was killed this week in a traffic accident in OKC. \"I know this is going to be a tough time for you and your family,\" Silver said, addressing the popular Thunder coach from his broadcast platform, \"but you have enormous support throughout the league.\" "},

In need of some magic, he reached deep down into his repertoire and found just enough left for one more go.  \"We were looking in our bag of tricks. Ain't nothing left,\" LaVine said. \"I just found a little piece of dust.\"  LaVine pulled off a between-the-legs dunk from the free throw line on the second tie-breaker to take home his second straight dunk contest trophy, becoming just the fourth player to pull off that feat.  The Minnesota Timberwolves guard had never tried the dunk before. Not in practice. Not at that playgrounds back home in Seattle. But he had already used all four of the dunks he planned to do when fellow contestant  told him to try it.  He pulled it off, putting an emphatic punctuation on a contest that instantly drew comparisons to the showdown between Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins in 1988.  \"I just think that was the best contest,\" LaVine said. \"There was some stuff that's never been done before. I don't want to get into the greats - Mike, they're in a different breath. If you really look at it as a whole, we were doing dunks that professional dunkers take four or five tries to do and we were doing it on the first try. It was ridiculous, man.\"  The night started as a coronation when on his first dunk LaVine grabbed the ball off the bounce, wrapped the ball around his back before cupping it with his right hand and threw it down. But once the contest was whittled to two contestants, Gordon put on a show every bit LaVine's equal.  \"I'm so happy I prepared some extras because usually you don't need them,\" LaVine said. \"People usually aren't that prepared to go up against you. But he deserved the title just as much as I did. He ... did some crazy, ridiculous dunks. I'm just glad I got the last laugh.\"  Gordon jumped over Magic mascot Stuff, who was standing on a hoverboard, for three of his dunks, including one in which he grabbed the ball and passed it underneath both legs before throwing it down. He also grabbed the ball out of a spinning Stuff's hand and threw down a huge 360 to open the final round.  \"If I knew it was going to be like that, I would have prepared better and we would have been here dunking all night, going back 50 after 50 after 50 after 50,\" Gordon said. \"We would have been here all night. I didn't know it was going to be like that.\"  The door finally opened for LaVine when Gordon was awarded a 47 on his fourth dunk of the second round, a Harold Miner-style jackknife.  Then LaVine shut it down.  \"Zach's an incredible dunker,\" Gordon said. \"He went through the legs from the free-throw line. That is insane. So off that dunk, you've got to give it to him. That's why the trophy's with him and not with me.\"  "},

It's even bigger for Nike, Under Armour, Adidas and Li-Ning.  With all the big stars in Toronto and millions of fans watching around the world, the big shoe companies have turned the basketball court into a fashion runway and unveiling specially designed sneakers during the game on Sunday. When it comes to the events of All-Star weekend, the shoe launches are right up there on the anticipation meter with the 3-point shootout and the slam dunk contest.  Wade has his designers from Chinese-based Li-Ning come up with something multicolored - almost rainbow-esque - with a shiny look. His fans can get them, but they'll have to work for it since only 100 pairs of Wade's All-Star shoe will be released.  \"When people get it they'll know this is a special All-Star to me,\" said Wade, a 12-time All-Star selection. \"I'm not going to have 12 more of these, so I'm going to make sure that this moment is something they remember was special if they get one of the sneakers.\"  The 100 pairs that he'll release will be numbered.  What Wade is wearing Sunday night won't be - his are a tad different.  \"I just think it's cool,\" Wade said. \"That's the story. All-Star weekend, just looking to do something that I thought was cool.\"  Wade is certainly not alone.  All-Stars  and James Harden will be wearing new Adidas sneakers during the game. James debuted a new version of his Nike sneakers this weekend called the 13 Lows, a black shoe with white and red trim and his signature King James logo on the tongue.  \"I got a great designer at Nike, Jason Petrie. We have consistent communication about what I want, what we want and what we want to do from a comfort, style, technology piece,\" James said. \"We pick each other's brain and go from there. We figure it out and stuff like this happens. It's pretty cool. The 13 Lows, coming to a city near you.\"  Curry's explosion in popularity over the last two years has helped Under Armour gain traction in the hyper-competitive shoe game. Like James and many of his contemporaries, Curry's goal is to follow in the footsteps of what Michael Jordan did at Nike, turning himself into the iconic pitchman and building an empire that has helped him become the owner of the Charlotte Hornets.  \"They had a nice template of success with Jordan's career,\" Curry said. \"We're trying to do it our way, which is very genuine and organic to what we're trying to do. It's been a great partnership so far. We're honestly just getting started with where we're at as a basketball brand and very excited about what's to come. It's nice to be as hands-on as I can be.\"  Jordan has shown that the shoe game offers the truly elite players a way to remain in the public consciousness long after their playing days are over. Indiana Pacers All-Star  sees Lakers star , who is playing in his final All-Star game, following a similar path with his Nike shoes, one that will get kids for generations to come interested in his dynamic game even though his career is coming to an end this season.  \"The people that didn't grow up watching Jordan, his shoes told stories,\" said George, who has worn Bryant's shoe since his high school days. \"From there, people wanted to Google and YouTube him. It kind of brings up everything in the past that Jordan did, brings that back to life. It keeps you relevant.\"  "},

{"url": "http://www.nba.com/2016/news/02/14/all-sta-2003-nba-draft-class.ap/index.html", "text": "  \u2014 On the night that he entered the NBA in 2003, someone asked  to assess the potential of the draft class that he was headlining as the No. 1 pick.  James answered quickly.  \"You'll see,\"' James said.  People did see, of course. And when it comes to the stars in that class, they're still seeing.  This All-Star weekend has been a celebration of all things , whose career ends when his 20th season concludes with the Los Angeles Lakers in a couple months. But his presence in Toronto also left some of the other veterans - like that 2003 draft foursome of James, ,  and  - taking stock of their own careers as well.  And while they're all still playing at an extremely high level, what they've already accomplished merits including them in the debate of which draft class was the best. Only four drafts in the last 40 years produced at least three 20,000-point scorers, and the 2003 group is on target to get there in a few weeks when Wade reaches that scoring milestone.  \"There's a lot of great draft classes, man,\" said Wade, citing 1984 and 1996 in particular. \"We've got a good draft class. We've got some good players, some Hall of Fame players in our draft class. But it's hard to compete against the past and what those players have done, especially when you're doing it still. You don't get that until it's all done and everybody sees the full body of work.\"  With Bryant, the body of work is easy: five championships, 18 All-Star nods, No. 3 on the all-time scoring list.  But he'll be gone soon, and other longtime stars like , ,  and  probably almost certainly aren't more than a couple years from their final games either.  So as strange as this seems to the players themselves, the 2003 group is on the verge of becoming the NBA's elder statesmen.  \"Look at Kobe's generation with Kobe, Duncan, Dirk and KG to name a few,\" James said. \"We're the next generation that comes after that, meaning myself, , D-Wade, Chris Bosh, Melo. They paved the way for us. You've got Kobe retiring, Timmy D is always on the fence of what he may do, KG as well.  \"It's like `Wow, we're the next wave,\"' James added. \"It'll be us next.\"  The exploits of the 2003 group are well-chronicled.  Wade won his first NBA championship in 2006 for Miami, then added more titles in 2012 and 2013 with Bosh and James as Heat teammates. Wade and James are 12-time All-Stars, Bosh is an 11-time selection and Anthony is a nine-time pick. James has four MVP awards and will be generally considered the best player of his era - if not any era.  They may be the best class ever.  James thinks so, for certain.  \"I'm definitely biased for sure,\" said James, who led the Cleveland Cavaliers to last season's NBA Finals and has them back atop the Eastern Conference standings this season. \"You just look at our resumes, the things that we've done in our class, we've got multiple champions, we've got MVPs, we have All-Stars, we have everything that you can ask for.\"  The sense of nostalgia is kicking in, without question. Wade has savored this All-Star weekend more than he has in previous years. Bosh stuck around even after pulling out of the game with an injury, just to remain part of the festivities. Anthony's phone has plenty of new videos he took to chronicle the weekend, including his son dunking during the All-Star Saturday Night event.  \"Every other guy in other classes, they can argue the same thing,\" Bosh said, when asked if the 2003 class is the best. \"You can talk about hardware and championships and MVPs and things of that nature. Having LeBron helps. Having Dwyane helps. Two of the greatest players ever to play this game. From top to bottom, it was a complete draft.\" "},

He was recalling the NBA's decision two years ago to bring All-Star Weekend to his city. At that time Ujiri had been running the Raptors for less than one season. He had all kinds of distant plans. Now he saw the chance to accelerate them.  \"That was the first thing that came to my mind, was that we are going to build this thing where we are trending the right way and it all comes together at All-Star,\" he said. \"We have the opportunity to showcase. People have to work a little bit harder, people have to work a little faster. But with the event coming, you have to seize the moment.\"  On Wednesday the Raptors opened their state-of-the-art practice facility, a project managed by director of basketball operations Teresa Resch. The plans had commenced in 2007, when Ujiri had been hired initially by the Raptors to work for his predecessor, GM Bryan Colangelo. The new BioSteel Centre features two full-size courts, a basketball ops center digitized by IBM Interactive Experience, spacious training and treatment areas, a full-service kitchen and a barber shop for the players. \"We wanted to get it done by All-Star,\" said Ujiri. \"So people could see.\"  By Thursday the best players in the world were arriving to join with Toronto's two All-Stars,  and . Their Raptors had climbed to No. 2 in the East with a wide 4.5-game lead over the rest of the field. Their success had enabled the Raptors to meet another kind of deadline that had been set by Ujiri two years ago.  \"I didn't want to be -- I hate to say it like this -- 10th or 11th in the East, and then somebody gets hurt, and they are giving you one spot for your All-Star player just to fill it because you are the home team,\" Ujiri said. \"Kyle and DeMar are All-Stars, and nobody can argue. They deserve it. You get two All-Stars because you are a good team in the East. That is the reality.\"  The goal was to transform this first-ever All-Star Weekend outside the U.S. into an opportunity to celebrate the progress that the Raptors and their president have been pursuing. The rising team, its improving infrastructure and its emerging investment in African basketball were all meant to be showcased during these few days, like a house-warming with the front doors flung open proudly to greet the entire basketball world. I feel responsible. You feel like you want it to go well. That is the weight on you. You wish that everyone would have a great time.\"\u2013 Masai Ujiri on Toronto hosting All-Star Weekend All-Star Weekend is a coming-out for this promising new era of Canadian basketball, and Ujiri, in his unofficial role as host, wanted his peers -- in North America as well as in Africa -- to respect this opportunity to define themselves on their own terms. For so many years there had been doubts that Americans would want to play on the other side of the border in Toronto, and now here -- with two years to get ready -- was this opportunity to set everyone straight.  \"I feel responsible,\" Ujiri said. \"You feel like you want it to go well. That is the weight on you. You wish that everyone would have a great time.\"  ***  \"He's an extremely special person,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver was saying on Friday of Ujiri. \"He almost has a magical quality to him. It feels like it's innate. People are naturally drawn to him.  \"The two times that I've been to Africa with him, with Basketball Without Borders in Johannesburg, to see the young boys and girls being drawn to him -- it is a privilege to see how he interacts with them. He literally sings to them. He gives them a philosophy of life and an energy. The platform is basketball, but 80 percent of it consists of life lessons.\"  On Thursday night Silver joined Rwanda president Paul Kagame and hundreds of other guests for the premiere at a Toronto movie theater of \"Giants of Africa,\" a documentary portraying Ujiri's efforts to create basketball camps for teenaged boys in Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana and his native Nigeria. This debut was another initiative that the Toronto GM was pushing to complete by the deadline of All-Star Weekend.  \"I've seen it, I would say, seven to eight times,\" said Ujiri, who received pre-screenings as filmmaker Hubert Davis transformed more than 300 hours of footage into a cohesive story. \"It impacts me the same way every single time. You see those kids and you just want to do better for them.\"  When Ujiri smiles on screen, he looks younger than his 46 years. But this is not a story of celebration, not quite yet. For much of the film he appears both weary and energized, like a political figure exhausted by all of the work to be done, and so many more problems than one man can fix. And yet Ujiri is resolute to do what he can. The players, as he moves among them, relieve him of his despair and renew his hope in them.  \"Our continent is going to be great,\" says Ujiri in the film. \"I just hope I'm alive when it is.\"  Some may question whether Ujiri's mission to use basketball as a tool on behalf of Africa is detracting from his work on behalf of the Raptors. The opposite is true. \"It makes everything better,\" Ujiri was saying here on Friday. \" said something very interesting this morning at the (NBA) Tech Summit. He said, 'It's not about working hard at 5:30 in the morning.' He said, 'You can come in early in the morning and say you are tired and blah, blah, blah. But I enjoyed doing it every single time. I enjoyed it.' And I thought that was great. Because I enjoy doing the work in Africa every single time.\" I have an opportunity to have a voice. I have an opportunity to help people, to give back. That means I have to win. I have to win on the court and off the court.\u2013 Masai Ujiri on his work in Africa Consider that Ujiri employs three Raptors scouts in different regions of Africa, which surely is going to emerge as the new frontier for NBA players. Much as the Spurs were ahead of other teams in their discovery of draft picks in Europe and South America, so too is Ujiri helping the Raptors by developing a pipeline of talent from Africa.  The work in Africa transcends the aspirations of his franchise, of course. After the premiere, Ujiri was approached by Lowry and DeRozan, who were emotional in their praise. \"For Masai, myself and many other African leaders, it is almost our obligation to go back and help,\" said , the Raptors center from Congo who attended the showing. \"By doing that it brings you joy. It brings you happiness, and I think that is my purpose: to help people.\"  Isn't teamwork likely to be enhanced when the key players -- including Raptors power forward , who was also in the audience -- see their leader devoted to a larger inspiring goal that puts the ambitions of their team into perspective?  \"I have an opportunity to have a voice,\" Ujiri said. \"I have an opportunity to help people, to give back. That means I have to win. I have to win on the court and off the court. It is really important. Losing is not an option. It is not an option.  \"People say I am the first African GM,\" Ujiri went on. \"It doesn't mean anything. It is meaningless if I'm going to be the only one. Do I want everybody to be calling me the first African GM 10 or 20 years from now if I'm the only African GM? That means I haven't done any work. Because if there are not people to follow after you, you have really not done anything.\"  ***  The two courts in the gym at Ryerson College were filled Saturday morning with 42 teenaged boys from Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe for Basketball Without Borders, the ongoing global initiative of the NBA and the international basketball federation FIBA. (Another camp for five girls from Africa and Canada was to hold a session Saturday at the Raptors' new facility.) The camp coaches and counselors included , the point guard of the Milwaukee Bucks, who came running from across the court to hug Ujiri.  \"This camp really changed my life, and it changed it dramatically,\" said Vasquez, who was a 15 year old from Venezuela when he participated in BWB in 2004, when the program was three years old. He moved from Caracas to the U.S., where he played at Montrose Christian School with  before moving onto Maryland. Vasquez spent two years with the Raptors before Ujiri traded him to the Bucks last summer.  \"He's a great friend, a guy that I love,\" Vasquez said of Ujiri. \"Because of this camp I met him. I remember he was a scout at the time. He was one of the speakers.\" What did Vasquez recall from Ujiri's speech? \"When you do the right thing when nobody is watching, you can fulfill your goals,\" said Vasquez. \"And that's what I did.\"  Dozens of NBA executives and scouts, including Ujiri, were lining the edges of the gym to focus on three prospects: 7-1 DeAndre Ayton of the Bahamas, 6-11 Omer Yurtseven of Turkey and Frank Ntilikina, a 6-5 point guard from France. Others were hoping to be noticed. \"When you are playing in your country, you don't really know how the other players of your age play,\" said Olivier Cortale, a 6-10 power forward from the French club Strasbourg. \"So you are here with all the people and you can compare yourself to them.\"  The busiest weekend of Ujiri's career still had hours to run. From here he would be leaving to host an NBA luncheon with a discussion panel on Africa. The plan for Sunday morning was to return to BWB in order to join Vasquez in speaking to the campers.  The opening of the practice facility, the debut of his documentary, the panel discussion in which he participated at the Tech Summit, appearances at the NBA owners' dinner and the NBA's Day of Service and then the All-Star Game on Sunday night -- all of it had been looming for two years like a finish line far away in the distance. \"Hopefully it is not something that just passes and goes,\" Ujiri said. \"Hopefully we continue to grow and be better.\"  Throughout the long weekend, whenever he could, Ujiri was engaging in trade discussions with his staff and with rival teams. When the All-Star Weekend closes up and the visitors leave, there will be new deadlines. Even now he was preparing for the next big thing.  "}]
