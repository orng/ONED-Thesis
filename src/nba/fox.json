Westbrook lost in the fan vote to fellow rookie, Spaniard Rudy Fernandez. That's right, Rudy Fernandez, who became the first international competitor ever in the dunk contest.\nSo Fernandez, who resumed his pro career in Spain in 2012, joined defending champion Dwight Howard, Nate Robinson, who ended up winning the title, and J.R.

Sacramento has made general manager change after general manager change, coaching change after coaching change since Vivek Ranadive's ownership group took over in 2013. Now, with Vlade Divac running the show in the front office, it appears there could be another regime stepping in not too long from now.\nVia :Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive and vice president of basketball operations Vlade Divac were using All-Star weekend in Toronto to canvass league officials on possible candidates to hire as general manager, league sources told The Vertical.  The Kings are starting to acknowledge that Divac has been overwhelmed with the complexities of the collective bargaining agreement and the sophisticated ways with which most NBA organizations are run now. Privately, the Kings have been telling people they plan to run a GM and a coaching search once the regular season ends. Sacramento has committed to keeping coach George Karl for the rest of the regular season, but has shown no inclination to bring him back next season, sources said\nAt 22-31, the Kings find themselves 4.5 games back of a playoff spot in the down-from-last-year Western Conference. Sacramento looked like it had a shot at one point, but has fallen off of late, mostly because of its wreched defense.\u00a0\nRanadive brought Divac in last season and named him vice president of basketball operations. At the time, Pete D'Alessandro was the GM and was running the organization. Divac had never even held a front office job. But Divac's hiring set the wheels in motion for him to take over the organization. D'Alessandro left that summer. It hasn't worked out well.\nJudging by some of the moves the Kings have made under Divac, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the team worries if its VP understands the complexities of the collective bargaining agreement. Front officers around the league have been studying the cap and cap-related moves for years in order to get where they currently stand. Divac just walked in the door.\nThis past summer, the Kings gave up a gluttony of draft picks, Carl Landry, Jason Thompson and Nik Stauskas, one year removed from being selected in the lottery of the draft, just to clear cap space. But they didn't have to give away their future in order to clean up enough space to sign Rajon Rondo\u00e2\u0080\u0094to a one-year deal\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Kosta Koufos, who the team .\nThe Kings have cycled through three coaches since Ranadive's first season as owner, 2013-14. The reports that Karl's ousting is  have been coming out for months now. Sacramento is supplying exactly zero stability. None for DeMarcus Cousins. None for their hopes of re-signing Rondo, who has been better this year than he was a season ago in Boston and Dallas. None for the dreams of developing their younger players.\u00a0\nCoaching turnover isn't the best thing for a young Willie Cauley-Stein. Regime changes turn roster consistency into a impossibility. But this is what's going on in Sacramento. Maybe the next GM or the next coach will actually stick."},

There's just one problem: They don't have the key asset that Love's current team, the , covets.\nThe Celtics are stocked with the draft picks and role players, and according to , that's not the type of package the Cavs expect in return if they decide to deal Love. According to the report, general manager David Griffin wants a star coming back.\nAcquiring one in a trade for Love now is easier said than done, so Cleveland is also working on upgrading its bench, according to the ESPN.com report, by making guard Iman Shumpert and center Timofey Mozgov available. The Cavs traded for both players during last season, but neither has compiled a productive season.\nThe Cavs would love to bring Atlanta Hawks' 3-point ace Kyle Korver to Cleveland. Other options, according to ESPN.com, include Sacramento Kings shooting guard Ben McLemore and center Kosta Koufos.\nAs for dealing Love, that might have to wait until the summer, if at all. The Cavs can see how the postseason goes and then decide if they want to continue on with the forward or move on from him. Under former coach David Blatt, Love never felt like a fit in the offense. However, Blatt's replacement, Tyronn Lue has made a point to get Love more touches at the elbow, his favored spot on the floor.\nThat experiment, however, is on hold after Love hurt his shoulder, the same one he injured in the first round of last season's playoffs and kept him out the remainder of the postseason (he's not expected to be out long this time.) You might recall that James and the Cavs mowed down the Eastern Conference to get to the Finals without Love in the second round and the East finals.\nCleveland might never be in this awkward position of deciding whether to trade Love, who is due north of $67 million through 2018-19 with a $25.5 million player option the following season, if they had never acquired him in the first place. Cleveland drafted  with the No. 1 overall pick in 2014. But when LeBron James decided to leave Miami as a free agent and return to Cleveland, he made it clear that he is in win-now mode and he wanted the veteran Love over the rookie Wiggins.\u00a0\nIn retrospect, the long and lanky, 6-foot-8 shooting guard might have been a solid, perhaps even dynamic two-way answer at that position for Cleveland -- maybe even a raw Dwyane Wade type of player -- something they are not getting from Shumpert.\u00a0\nBut that deal is done and there's no undoing it. At present, the Cavs must decide how imperative it is to move on without Love, and how high a price will they really demand."},

The guy who just surpassed Kobe Bryant as the All-Star Game\u2019s all-time leading scorer \u2026 in six fewer appearances? That guy?\nYeah, he\u2019s still a thing.\nYou might not have noticed him if you were paying attention to the dominant storylines of the season.\u00a0\nKobe Bryant\u2019s retirement farewell tour and Stephen Curry\u2019s historical level of dominance have cast James into a supporting role for the first time in nearly a decade. When was the last time we talked about him this infrequently? 2008? 2007? Heck, before he was in high school?\nOther players, teams and narratives have had their moments, but James has always been the biggest story. His legacy. His decisions. His style of play. He\u2019s always been it.\u00a0\nAnd yet now he\u2019s not. Or at least not right now.\nThe 2016 All-Star Game characterized James\u2019 relative anonymity in stunning fashion.\u00a0\nThe entire contest was revolved around Bryant\u2019s curtain call, with celebrations before, during and after the game. Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Anthony Davis and John Wall all got their moments as well. Kevin Durant and James Harden got buckets, too. Curry made a halfcourt shot that sent the crowd into a frenzy.\u00a0\nJames, though, finished with just 13 points (6-13 FG, 1-5 3PT), four rebounds and seven assists in 20 minutes and, besides a few impressive dunks and a playful defensive encounter with Bryant, remained in the shadows.\u00a0\nThe only All-Stars who played more than him yet scored less were Dwyane Wade (eight points), Klay Thompson (nine) and, of course, Bryant (10). In a game featuring the league\u2019s brightest stars, LeBron James was a subplot.\nIt was only the second time James had played fewer than 30 minutes in his 12 All-Star appearances (and marked his fewest minutes ever), and his 13 points matched his previous low from 2005, his first All-Star Game.\nJames didn\u2019t play in the fourth quarter and played only 6:24 in the second half. Part of that, according to Eastern Conference All-Star and  head coach Tyronne Lue, was by design.\n\u201cBefore the game, he just said he wanted to play six minutes in the quarter, in the fourth quarter,\u201d Lue said. \u201cIf it was close, in reach, he'd play more minutes. Just talking to Carmelo, D-Wade and LeBron, once it got out of hand, just sent the young guys in to play and let them enjoy it.\u201d\nNo All-Star coach wants to tax his own player -- and risk injury -- in a meaningless exhibition game. The matchup was out of hand midway through the third quarter, and there was no point in putting James back in. That makes sense. Lue wanted to give other players who might not even be All-Stars next season a chance to enjoy the moment.\nJames didn\u2019t fully get to enjoy his moment, though. Bryant started the night as the All-Star Game\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 280 points, holding a two-point edge over James\u2019 278. By the end of the game, James narrowly surpassed Bryant, 291-290 -- and will only expand his lead from there.\nYet few acknowledged the stat. Here is James, who\u2019s only played in 12 All-Star Games, surpassing Bryant, who\u2019s played after 15 of his 18 selections, and it flew under the radar. Not that James cared.\n\u201cOh, it absolutely means nothing,\u201d James said. \u201cIt means absolutely nothing (smiling). I'm just blessed to be a part of All-Star Weekend. This being my 12th consecutive appearance, being able to start for the East, it means a lot to my family and my fans. But the scoring, that's never meant nothing to me.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t to say James isn\u2019t one of the game\u2019s biggest stars. The media still discusses him constantly, and fans continuously debate his overall place in the NBA pantheon. He still has the .\u00a0\nIt\u2019s just that before the coverage surrounding his every move was insane, unprecedented and, at times, even annoying. No one -- neither Michael Jordan nor Magic Johnson nor Kobe Bryant -- has ever been covered the way LeBron has, and that was part of what made him special. If your nicknames are The Chosen One and King James, you\u2019re going to upset a lot of people and drive a lot of conversation.\nBut that\u2019s finally started to change. People care a little less now -- perhaps because he hasn\u2019t won a championship over the past two seasons and looks like an overwhelming underdog to win one this season -- and any drop-off in the coverage of James is easy to notice. There are varying levels of stardom, and he\u2019s always been on the extreme end. When people aren\u2019t talking about him all the time, it\u2019s just weird. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re at currently.\nDepending on your opinion of Curry and Bryant, James is probably No. 2 or No. 3 overall in metaphorical player power rankings (there\u2019s an argument to be made regarding the order of the three, though the best indication could be All-Star voting, in which James was third). \u00a0\nThis won\u2019t last forever, of course. Bryant\u2019s retirement will be a thing of the past next season. Curry and the Golden State Warriors won\u2019t likely be 48-4 at the All-Star break again. The San Antonio Spurs could be without Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili. There will possibly be a lack of drama, and the quickest way to stir up controversy is to bring up the King.\nWe\u2019re not talking about him now, but that\u2019s bound to change. Or maybe it\u2019s not, barring his leaving Cleveland or winning a championship (one could reasonably argue neither is likely).\nThough Sunday\u2019s game signified the end of the Bryant era, maybe it also signified the end of LeBron\u2019s era dominating the media -- or, if that\u2019s too outrageous, at least illuminated the trend.\u00a0\nThe game is heading in a new direction, with new stars. James is a legend, an all-time great, a top-10 all-time player just past the halfway point of his career. But he\u2019s also less interesting than he used to be -- or perhaps we\u2019re just less interested.\n\n\u00a0"},

Everyone else in the NBA is chasing the Warriors.\n The defending champions have been so dominant that they could already be a 50-win team this weekend. And unless opponents start figuring out a way to slow Stephen Curry and the league's most potent offense, they could be the best team ever by the time they're done.\n Curry and fellow All-Stars Klay Thompson and Draymond Green took time out for fun in the first All-Star Game held outside the U.S., where Curry tossed in the final points in the highest-scoring game ever with a 42-footer to give the West a 196-173 victory.\n It won't be long before they get serious again.\n ''Yeah, obviously, Thursday, Friday, when games start up, put our game face back on and figure out how we're going to try to finish out the season strong and go after another championship,'' Curry said.\n They are 48-4 and will bring an 11-game winning streak into Portland on Friday when their season resumes. Golden State could reach 50 wins - for many clubs, the mark of a very good regular season - with a victory Saturday against the Los Angeles Clippers in what's become perhaps the league's testiest rivalry.\n The NBA record of 72 wins, set 20 years ago by Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls, could be in reach.\n ''If it's there for us we want to get it, but at the end of the day we're trying to win a championship,'' Thompson said.\n There are a couple of teams in the West, and a front-runner in the East that could pose the toughest challenges to the Warriors.\n San Antonio, Oklahoma City and Cleveland seem to have the best chances to prevent Golden State from repeating, though the Warriors blew out the Spurs and Cavaliers last time they met.\n Business comes before basketball this week, as the trade deadline is Thursday afternoon, a few hours before the season resumes. Contenders will try to load up and disappointments can break up.\n From there, there's less than two months before the playoffs begin.\n LeBron James dismissed a report this week that the Cavaliers were discussing trading Kevin Love, saying they had enough to win after a turbulent first half that included the firing of coach David Blatt not long after Kyrie Irving had returned from knee surgery.\n ''Every piece that we have means a lot to the process,'' James said. ''Obviously with myself, Kyrie and Kev, we spearhead the whole thing. We're focused on the main thing and knowing what the main thing is every day, we're going to have a great chance.''\n So will the Spurs, who are just 3 1/2 games behind Golden State at 45-8, and like the Warriors are unbeaten at home. They have won six in a row even while Manu Ginobili is recovering from surgery, as star offseason acquisition LaMarcus Aldridge looks more comfortable playing for his new team.\n ''We've been winning and we're putting ourselves in a position to be special,'' Aldridge said. ''So that's what it's about.''\n There's plenty more to watch down the stretch, from Kobe Bryant's final games before retirement to the rookie of the year race between Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns and New York's Kristaps Porzingis.\n But the focus will never be too far from the Warriors and Curry, who seems headed for a second straight MVP award. Their record-setting start to the season brought unusually high attention to the NBA's pre-Christmas schedule, and a strong finish and a chance at 73 wins would do the same during March Madness.\n The record would be nice. The Warriors would prefer another ring.\n ''I think we just want more. We're not satisfied with winning the championship,'' Green said. ''We think we have something special and it only lasts so long, so we want to take advantage of that and not get complacent. Let's continue to try to get more.''"},

''I was in too much pain.''\n Bosh has taken precautions over the last year to try and prevent the recurrence of a clot, including partnering with Janssen Pharmaceuticals - the maker of the commonly used blood thinner Xarelto - to educate people about the risks. After the clot last season was found, Bosh started taking that blood thinner for several months as part of his recovery.\n Athletes in contact sports typically cannot play while taking blood thinners."},

However, George's nine 3-pointers were a record, and the 173 points scored by his team were more than any All-Star team had scored before Sunday. Unfortunately, the West\u2019s 196 shattered the former high of 163 as well.. was dominant tonight!   \n\u201cI think to start out, everyone wants a chance to win MVP in the All-Star Game,\u201d said George, who lost out on the award to the Thunder's Russell Westbrook. \u201cThat was definitely a goal.\u201d\nGeorge is certainly one of the NBA\u2019s 15 best players, but this night's performance \u2014 and the possible All-NBA season he is having \u2014 weren\u2019t necessarily a given.\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that George was rehabbing a broken leg, one which he shattered in August of 2014 during Team USA\u2019s opening scrimmage before the team shipped off to win the FIBA World Cup. George missed almost all of last season before returning in April to play limited minutes in the final six contests for a Pacers team that was out of the playoff picture.\n\u201cI had a hard-fought summer, hard-fought rehab year,\u201d George said. \u201cIt was just a very upward climb. It took every day and really every moment of rehab to get through it. There were a lot of days where I felt like I was down and out, but just stayed with it.\u201d\nIt was more than just an unfortunate development. The Pacers wing made All-NBA Third-Teams as a 22- and 23-year-old in 2013 and 2014. And the leg injury was an obvious hurdle. From the outside, though, it appears George, with or without a healthy stub, jumped it with ease. scored an  career-best 41 points on his ASG record-setting 9 made 's!

It really must be amazing.\u201d\nSunday night wasn\u2019t out of character for the now 25-year-old George. He\u2019s in the midst of the best season of his career.\u00a0He remains one of the NBA's best defensive players. On top of that, he's posting career-high efficiency numbers while shooting more than ever before.\u00a0\nEfficiency and usage are supposed to have inverse relationships.\u00a0Unless you\u2019re getting better. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with George, who has helped the currently No. 6-seeded Pacers back into the Eastern Conference playoff picture after a one-year hiatus from April and May basketball.\n\u201cTo come back and play at that level athletically, it just stuns me every time I see him out there,\u201d Popovich continued. \u201c... I know it\u2019s taken him a while, but it\u2019s pretty incredible. It\u2019s great that he\u2019s back.\u201d\nIt's meaningful that George is playing like this, even in a game where meaning is hard to come by. When LeBron James was asked if passing Kobe Bryant on Sunday to become the all-time scoring leader in All-Star Game history meant anything, for example, he shrugged it off.\n\u201cIt means absolutely nothing,\u201d he deadpanned.\nThe individual act of George coming within a point of Wilt means similarly little \u2014 even if approaching any WILT scoring record is all-caps deserving. Solely dropping in nine triples doesn\u2019t mean anything, either.

The Cavaliers have been atop the East for most of the season, and even though the Raptors are playing well the race to the No. 1 seed still goes through Cleveland. The Celtics went into the break with 10 wins in their last 12 games, so the long layoff might not have helped them from a momentum standpoint. And the Hawks seem a bit vulnerable, but it's almost inconceivable to see them outside the playoff mix.\n Out: New York, Milwaukee, Brooklyn, Philadelphia. The Knicks are five games back of the No. 8 spot, fired their coach and Carmelo Anthony's knee is problematic. Milwaukee is tough at home (15-8) but horrid on the road (7-24). Brooklyn and Philadelphia are lottery-bound.\n So that leaves: , Indiana, Chicago, Charlotte, Detroit, Washington and Orlando, in a seven-team race for four spots. Charlotte won seven of 10 going into the break. Miami is waiting to see how badly hurt Chris Bosh's calf is, and either way the  seem as though they're in trade-for-someone mode. Indiana and Chicago would figure to be probable playoff teams, depending on health.\n The picks: Miami, Indiana, Chicago and Detroit get into the field.\n WESTERN CONFERENCE:\n In: Golden State, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles Clippers. With the first three teams, no explanation is necessary. The Clippers have gotten better without Blake Griffin, somehow.\n Out: Denver, New Orleans, Minnesota, Phoenix, Los Angeles Lakers. The Nuggets are only five games out, but it's just so hard to envision them making that strong a run. The Pelicans' season was snake-bitten from the beginning, and the others know continued rebuilding modes await.\n So that leaves: Memphis, Dallas, Portland, Utah, Houston and Sacramento, in a six-team race for four spots. Marc Gasol's injury leaves the  in some trouble, obviously. The job coach Quin Snyder has done with the Jazz has been fantastic, and the league seems to be taking notice. And Portland is hanging on in its first season without LaMarcus Aldridge.\n The picks: Memphis, Dallas, Utah and Houston round out the West bracket.\n ---\n WHAT TO WATCH\n College games on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday will have to suffice for those who need a nightly hoops fix on television. The NBA returns on Thursday, and here are some of the games to note this coming week:\n - Chicago at Cleveland, Thursday: The Bulls will come out of the break holding only seventh place in the East, and Jimmy Butler's absence won't help.\n - San Antonio at L.A. Clippers, Thursday: The Spurs won their first meeting this season, but visit the Clippers for the first time since last year's Game 7 loss.\n - Miami at Atlanta, Friday: The Heat will be without suspended center Hassan Whiteside, and Bosh's availability is unknown because of a calf issue.\n - New York at Minnesota, Saturday: The Timberwolves get to welcome home All-Star Skills Challenge winner Karl-Anthony Towns and dunk champ Zach LaVine.\n - Memphis at Toronto, Sunday: Notable because the Raptors get their ''normal'' arena back, after Air Canada Centre was transformed for All-Star weekend.\n ---\n STAT LINE OF THE WEEK\n Given there were so few games, we'll go a different route this week and offer just one number instead: 6.\n In Toronto, the city now often referred to as ''The 6'' - a nod to a lyric in a hit song from native son Drake - it took six dunks over the course of the evening for LaVine to defend his slam-dunk title. He beat Orlando's Aaron Gordon in that won't-be-forgotten-soon final round."},

It's been challenged recently --  point guard Russell Westbrook had 41 points last year -- and considering the absolute refusal to play any semblance of defense and the number or lethal scorers in the league, it's a minor miracle the record is still standing.\nOr Sunday night, Pop took matters into his own hands.\nSome coaches might have just had fun with it and allowed George to continue his onslaught right past Chamberlain's 42. But Popovich wasn't about to watch Wilt's record fall in a game played as loosey goosey as this one was. So Popovich summoned arguably the game's best defender, Golden State forward  off the bench to stick on George for the final few minutes.Paul George was one point away from tying Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s ASG record of 42 points, so Pop sent the double-team \nGreen afterward told reporters, , what his orders were upon his return to the floor:\"We don't want any records like that broken on us, so just trying to contest the shot.\"\nGreen did his job, hounding George into a 3-point misfire with just under one minute left. It was George's last shot of the game, and Wilt's record survived the highest scoring All-Star Game ever.They weren't trying to let me break that record,\" George told TNT in a televised interview. \"I shot the 3 when I could have got a layup. If I had known that, I would have dunked.\"\nGeorge said he didn't realize he was just one point away from tying the record or else he would have gone in for what surely would have been another uncontested layup instead of heaving his 19th 3-pointer of the game.\nKudos to Pop for making sure at least a minute or two of the All-Star Game included some real-game strategy. All those dunks off passes off the backboard and a myriad of circus alley-oops and uncountable 3-pointers can be fun, but it sure can get awfully boring, too.\nGeorge's long-range accuracy was certainly something to behold (he made 9 of 19 from beyond the arc), but until the game returns to something resembling a competitive nature, no player should be simply allowed to stroll past an all-time great.\nPopovich made sure George didn't.\u00a0"},

It was about respect, ours for him and the respect he's given us. I just wanted to tell him that his respect meant a lot, means a lot, to my career.

Howard is averaging a career-low 14.6 points a game while taking just 8.8 shots a game, the lowest since his rookie season. He can opt out of his contract and become a free agent this summer, meaning he could leave Houston with the Rockets receiving nothing in return.\nRockets general manager Daryl Morey has reportedly been gauging the trade market for Howard with the NBA's trade deadline.

They're 7-4 without him this season, and 1-4 since he returned from a sprained ankle.\nThere's been rumors that Howard doesn't enjoy playing with James Harden, and really since the Rockets acquired Howard, 30, there have been doubts that he is a good fit for Houston's offensive system. And, in fact, Howard ranks fifth on the team in total field goal attempts.

Private chats with teammates in the locker room, which he enjoyed tremendously.\n But the quintessential one to Bryant came in the wee hours of Sunday morning inside a rented-out restaurant, where he was the guest of honor at a celebration arranged by Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade.\n Bryant was publicly serenaded all weekend, and having 20,000 fans chant his name left him beaming. Having three longtime rivals quietly pay tribute meant even more.\n ''It was really special,'' Bryant told The Associated Press on Sunday night after scoring 10 points in his last All-Star appearance, a 196-173 win for the West over the East. ''Those are the things you don't get a chance to hear when you're competing against each other. To hear those stories now, you have such a deep sense of appreciation and such a brotherhood from all the years of competing against each other. It just felt good.''\n They gave him some silly gifts. They presented him with a giant bottle of wine, a 1996 vintage in a nod to his rookie season. And they told Bryant what he meant to their lives.\n The dinner was secret, super-exclusive, invitation-only. It's something the trio started doing last season at All-Star weekend, calling the gathering the Gentleman's Supper Club. This year, the group wanted Bryant to be tied into it somehow.\n So after All-Star Saturday festivities ended, the group headed out to the party that mattered most to them. Dinner was a fish dish, and it wasn't served until after 2 a.m. The wine and spirits were flowing long before that, and for a little while afterward as well. By the time everything had wound down, sunrise wasn't far away.\n But to those who were there, it was most memorable.\n ''Respect,'' Wade said. ''That's what it was. It was about respect, ours for him and the respect he's given us. I just wanted to tell him that his respect meant a lot, means a lot, to my career. I went down a list of moments, gave people insight on Kobe and the way he thinks. It was just appreciation, man. His drive, his competitiveness, it helped me early in my career because I wanted to be on his level.''\n Bryant hasn't always had the tightest relationships with NBA peers. He's never been the sort that needs tons of friends, and his competitive juices sometimes kept him from allowing himself to get close with too many people. But now that his career is winding down, many close to Bryant are seeing some changes.\n He has thoroughly enjoyed the tributes he's received in every city the  have visited since his retirement announcement. He made his peace long ago with  not being in position right now to compete for the postseason.\n ''This is amazing,'' Bryant said at the restaurant, glass in hand. ''I'm not the most social person, so to get this from you guys means absolutely everything to me.''\n Wade gave him a customized robe and some other clothes bearing his logo - along with a one-year subscription to Netflix, because Bryant is about to have a lot of time on his hands. Paul gave him a bunch of presents that he said would properly prepare Bryant for retirement, such as dental adhesive, reading glasses, compression socks and a cane. Anthony offered a magnum of Gaja Barbaresco, Italian wine for the player who grew up in Italy and says much like vino itself he got better with age.\n But there was also a serious tone, as Bryant nodded during his speech toward his wife, Vanessa.\n ''The thing that I'll miss is matching up with you guys,'' Bryant told Wade, Anthony and Paul. ''Vanessa will tell you: I'll be in the bed for hours - hours, man - not sleeping, watching film on you guys because you are driving me (expletive) crazy.''\n He can start sleeping soon, if he isn't already.\n The last All-Star Game is in the books. The NBA journey is almost over. He may have participated in his last practice on Saturday. The legendary ride has 27 games left, at the most. And before he left Toronto for a quick family vacation before the season resumes later this week, Bryant took one final moment to reflect.\n ''It has hit me,'' Bryant said. ''I feel very thankful. I feel very thankful. It's not an exciting thing. It's not a sad thing. It's just, I feel very thankful to be able to have had the career I've had.''"},

Most players don't have much input on the sets they run on their respective teams -- unless they're LeBron James -- so the All-Star Game is their lone chance to atone for that in a loose, meaningless exhibition game.\nThe 2016 Western Conference All-Stars, who crushed the East, 196-173, are a cerebral bunch, so naturally West All-Star head coach Gregg Popovich was asked after the win about which of his players drew up the best play in a huddle.\nThe answer, to many people's surprise, was not the person you'd expect.\n\"DeMarcus Cousins,\" Popovich said. \"We gave him the clipboard and he said get out of my way, go flat on the baseline and I'm shooting it, and he made the three. That might be the only one that worked all night long.\"\nHere's the play Popovich was referencing:Boogie showing the range! \nCousins isn't exactly known for making the smartest decisions on a basketball court, as he has notoriously been among the league leaders in technical fouls and feuded with several of his head coaches since entering the league in 2010.\u00a0\nWith that said, Pop clearly had a joking undertone, and it's not as if Cousins drew up an intricate action -- he simply told his teammates to clear out and let him go to work (not unlike what happens sometimes in Sacramento). Cousins has expanded his range to 3-point territory this season -- making 1.2 per game and shooting 34.9 percent on 3s -- and calling his own number paid off on the biggest stage he's played on.\nOn paper, Cousins might've been the last West All-Star one would expect to design a successful play. But that's what makes him Boogie. He's talented enough to do what he wants, even if it's unconventional, and most of the time it works out.\n"},

The 2000-01 Lakers went 15-1 in the playoffs, which is the best win percentage in the playoffs history.\nHe's also shown he knows a thing or two about loyalty. While some of Kobe Bryant's former teammates have bashed him in recent years -- on and off the record -- Fox has never said a bad word about Bryant or the Lakers in the public eye. Fox, an NBA analyst for NBATV, certainly has the platform to speak out against the Lakers, yet refuses to.\nBut that doesn't mean he would go back and play for them -- at least not in their current state. Fox sees a great thing going up in Northern California -- a team playing as well as the teams he played on, if not better -- and wishes he could join in on the fun.\nFollowing the 2016 All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday night, Fox was asked about which team he would most like to play for in today's era.\u00a0\nInstead of picking his former team, the Lakers, where he'd likely start at small forward (and have Bryant move to shooting guard, putting Jordan Clarkson or Lou Williams on the bench as the sixth man), Fox went with the popular pick, the flavor of the month (and perhaps the decade): the Golden State Warriors.\n\u201cProbably the Golden State Warriors, if I\u2019m going to be honest,\" Fox said. \"I want to be on a championship team.\u201d\nHey, at least he's honest.\nFox was then asked who his favorite player was currently, and instead of going with his former teammate, Bryant, Fox said he most enjoys watching the reigning MVP.\n\u201cSteph Curry,\" Fox said without hesitation.\nIt looks the Warriors have won over even one of the most loyal former Lakers with their brand of basketball. Fox, a gritty defender and solid 3-point shooter, would fit in perfectly off the bench for the Warriors as a small-ball 4 or small forward.\nNot that Golden State needs any more shooters.\n"},
{"url": "http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/the-2003-draft-class-still-going-all-star-strong-021416", "text": "\n TORONTO (AP) On the night that he entered the NBA in 2003, someone asked  to assess the potential of the draft class that he was headlining as the No. 1 pick.\n James answered quickly.\n ''You'll see,''' James said.\n People did see, of course. And when it comes to the stars in that class, they're still seeing.\n This All-Star weekend has been a celebration of all things Kobe Bryant, whose career ends when his 20th season concludes with the Los Angeles Lakers in a couple months. But his presence in Toronto also left some of the other veterans - like that 2003 draft foursome of James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade - taking stock of their own careers as well.\n And while they're all still playing at an extremely high level, what they've already accomplished merits including them in the debate of which draft class was the best. Only four drafts in the last 40 years produced at least three 20,000-point scorers, and the 2003 group is on target to get there in a few weeks when Wade reaches that scoring milestone.\n ''There's a lot of great draft classes, man,'' said Wade, citing 1984 and 1996 in particular. ''We've got a good draft class. We've got some good players, some Hall of Fame players in our draft class. But it's hard to compete against the past and what those players have done, especially when you're doing it still. You don't get that until it's all done and everybody sees the full body of work.''\n With Bryant, the body of work is easy: five championships, 18 All-Star nods, No. 3 on the all-time scoring list.\n But he'll be gone soon, and other longtime stars like Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce probably almost certainly aren't more than a couple years from their final games either.\n So as strange as this seems to the players themselves, the 2003 group is on the verge of becoming the NBA's elder statesmen.\n ''Look at Kobe's generation with Kobe, Duncan, Dirk and KG to name a few,'' James said. ''We're the next generation that comes after that, meaning myself, Chris Paul, D-Wade, Chris Bosh, Melo. They paved the way for us. You've got Kobe retiring, Timmy D is always on the fence of what he may do, KG as well.\n ''It's like `Wow, we're the next wave,''' James added. ''It'll be us next.''\n The exploits of the 2003 group are well-chronicled.\n Wade won his first NBA championship in 2006 for , then added more titles in 2012 and 2013 with Bosh and James as  teammates. Wade and James are 12-time All-Stars, Bosh is an 11-time selection and Anthony is a nine-time pick. James has four MVP awards and will be generally considered the best player of his era - if not any era.\n They may be the best class ever.\n James thinks so, for certain.\n ''I'm definitely biased for sure,'' said James, who led the  to last season's NBA Finals and has them back atop the Eastern Conference standings this season. ''You just look at our resumes, the things that we've done in our class, we've got multiple champions, we've got MVPs, we have All-Stars, we have everything that you can ask for.''\n The sense of nostalgia is kicking in, without question. Wade has savored this All-Star weekend more than he has in previous years. Bosh stuck around even after pulling out of the game with an injury, just to remain part of the festivities. Anthony's phone has plenty of new videos he took to chronicle the weekend, including his son dunking during the All-Star Saturday Night event.\n ''Every other guy in other classes, they can argue the same thing,'' Bosh said, when asked if the 2003 class is the best. ''You can talk about hardware and championships and MVPs and things of that nature. Having LeBron helps. Having Dwyane helps. Two of the greatest players ever to play this game. From top to bottom, it was a complete draft.''"},

When it comes to the events of All-Star weekend, the shoe launches are right up there on the anticipation meter with the 3-point shootout and the slam dunk contest.\n Wade has his designers from Chinese-based Li-Ning come up with something multicolored - almost rainbow-esque - with a shiny look. His fans can get them, but they'll have to work for it since only 100 pairs of Wade's All-Star shoe will be released.\n ''When people get it they'll know this is a special All-Star to me,'' said Wade, a 12-time All-Star selection. ''I'm not going to have 12 more of these, so I'm going to make sure that this moment is something they remember was special if they get one of the sneakers.''\n The 100 pairs that he'll release will be numbered.\n What Wade is wearing Sunday night won't be - his are a tad different.\n ''I just think it's cool,'' Wade said. ''That's the story. All-Star weekend, just looking to do something that I thought was cool.''\n Wade is certainly not alone.\n James debuted a new version of his Nike sneakers this weekend called the 13 Lows, a black shoe with white and red trim and his signature King James logo on the tongue.\n ''I got a great designer at Nike, Jason Petrie. We have consistent communication about what I want, what we want and what we want to do from a comfort, style, technology piece,'' James said. ''We pick each other's brain and go from there. We figure it out and stuff like this happens. It's pretty cool. The 13 Lows, coming to a city near you.''\n Curry's explosion in popularity over the last two years has helped Under Armour gain traction in the hyper-competitive shoe game. Like James and many of his contemporaries, Curry's goal is to follow in the footsteps of what Michael Jordan did at Nike, turning himself into the iconic pitchman and building an empire that has helped him become the owner of the Charlotte Hornets.\n ''They had a nice template of success with Jordan's career,'' Curry said. ''We're trying to do it our way, which is very genuine and organic to what we're trying to do. It's been a great partnership so far. We're honestly just getting started with where we're at as a basketball brand and very excited about what's to come. It's nice to be as hands-on as I can be.''\n Jordan has shown that the shoe game offers the truly elite players a way to remain in the public consciousness long after their playing days are over. Indiana Pacers All-Star Paul George sees Lakers star Kobe Bryant, who is playing in his final All-Star game, following a similar path with his Nike shoes, one that will get kids for generations to come interested in his dynamic game even though his career is coming to an end this season.\n ''The people that didn't grow up watching Jordan, his shoes told stories,'' said George, who has worn Bryant's shoe since his high school days. ''From there, people wanted to Google and YouTube him. It kind of brings up everything in the past that Jordan did, brings that back to life. It keeps you relevant.''\n ---\n AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this report."},

Bryant finished with 10 points on 4-of-11 shooting in just less than 26 minutes as the West beat the East 196-173 and Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook taking home MVP honors.No, thank YOU!   \n\"It was fun,\" Bryant said afterward. \"I had a blast playing with those guys, laughing and joking with them on the bench. And, you know, I got a chance to stop Pau [Gasol] in a post, redeem myself from what he did to me when Chicago came to town. But all those things are just fun. I had a great time. I had a great, great time.\"Just soak it in,  \nSince announcing his plans to retire after the season, Bryant has been content to move through his final campaign with a sense of calm and appreciation. He had hinted that there would be no final attempt to claim one last MVP trophy, and that he'd be perfectly fine playing limited minutes while simply showing up to bask in the All-Star festivities one final time.\u00a0\nBryant's first bucket came more than seven minutes in, on a signature turnaround fadeaway jumper over Toronto's Kyle Lowry. Bryant's next made shot was an open 3 five minutes into the second quarter. The next was similar to his first, but on the baseline this time while New York's Carmelo Anthony defended closely.\u00a0\nBryant's final basket of the night went down with just more than a minute to play in the first half, a layup after a drive from the 3-point line as the defenders stood and watched.\u00a0\nThere were moments of simulated one-on-one matchups, including a particularly entertaining sequence against Cleveland's LeBron James which resulted in Bryant double-pumping before launching a long two-pointer that missed.\u00a0ISO ISO ISO! Little gamesmanship between two legends    \nThese were playful sequences, and any form of aggressive competition was completely absent \u2014 unlike Bryant's first All-Star Game when he went at Michael Jordan for real back in 1998. But Kobe said things are very different for him now than they were for Michael back then, and explained why no one took a real shot at him in what was confirmed to be his final appearance.\n\"Michael was still Michael,\" Bryant said. \"I mean it was '98. I mean, he was that guy. I'm 20 years in and it's different. These kids, they're so many generations removed from that, that it's not even about that anymore because they've literally grown up watching me since the age of 7. So it's different than when I went at Michael.\"\nThere's nothing to prove for the league's youth against Kobe Bryant now, even though so many of them will tell you that Kobe was the Jordan of their generation. As Bryant reflected on what he'll take away from interacting with the league's current crop of stars one last time, he said it was the stories that younger players shared with him that ultimately will mean the most.\n\"I think it's the stories of when they first came into the league and they were matching up against me,\" Bryant said. \"And just kind of the little things \u2014 an elbow here or a steal here, and then wanting to earn my respect at an early age, right? Coming into the league, playing against me, wanting to prove to me that they were as competitive.\n\"When I hear those kind of stories, man, that makes me feel real good. Because over the years you're competing against each other. Those aren't stories you're ever going to share with somebody that you're competing against, right? But at this stage, it feels absolutely wonderful to hear these those things.\""},

Yet if LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and the rest of the All-Stars had listened to , things could have been a lot better.\nSunday's game wasn't bad by any means. It was by all accounts a typical All-Star Game, with zero defense and slam dunks galore \u2014 although one which set an NBA record for most total points in an All-Star Game\u00a0in a 196-173 win for the Western Conference. It was a fun contest, if nothing special, summed up in large part by this uncontested Paul George dunk: breaks down the Ole defense & finishes with the flush on TNT!  \nIt was also Bryant's final All-Star Game, as you've probably heard by now. And he deserved better than this. Or, rather, he asked for more than this. Before the weekend began, Bryant told his fellow All-Stars that this isn't the setting to pass and defer to anyone, even a future Hall of Famer like Kobe who's planned to take in all the sights and sounds one last time ():Yet, Bryant did not sound thrilled on the idea that his Western Conference teammates could help him. Bryant reported dismissively questioning Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry after the NBA's reigning MVP told him, \u201cI have a lot of assists for you.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018No. What are you doing? You're a shooter. You grew up watching me. What the hell are you talking about that you want to pass me the ball at an All-Star game. Are you crazy?\u201d\nNo, my friends: The All-Star Game is for looking out for No. 1. It's for embracing the Black Mamba mentality and trying out what it's like to be Kobe, even for just one night:\u00a0\"This is what I'll miss...that interaction and the competitiveness.\" - \nThat's how the NBA's All-Stars should have honored Bryant one final time \u2014 by going at each other with a competitive fire usually seen in games that matter. We're not asking for lockdown defense and guys risking injury, mind you; we simply would have preferred one-on-one gamesmanship and a little bit of pride being displayed in place of the hot-potato passes and lobs that too often ended in half-hearted layups.\nAgain, the basketball was fine, for the most part. Sure, Paul George (game-high 41 points and five rebounds) and Anthony Davis (24 points and six rebounds) put up numbers, and it was great to see those two in elite form. It just wasn't the sendoff we'd hoped Bryant would receive.\nYet there was one player who did right by Bryant on Sunday night. Without him, the night would have been wholly forgettable.\u00a0Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook brought the noise early, often and, fittingly, via Bryant: \u27a1\ufe0f  \nHe stared down opponents and uncurled his trademark smirk. He destroyed all who stood in his way \u2014 and by the end of the night, Westbrook had would-be defenders completely shook: It's all yours, Russ! \nYou might watch that dunk and imagine it's just typical All-Star defense. Make no mistake, however; anyone who watched this game knows that was a reaction to the ferocity with which Westbrook was looking to embarrass people.Cut it out !! \nIt didn't hurt that Westbrook had his Thunder teammate Durant to set him up, of course:The Thunder Duo are stealing the show!  \nOr that West coach Gregg Popovich gave him the clipboard and let him call the shots:Listen in! Russ draws up a play for the West.  \nNot that Westbrook needed designed plays, naturally; with the way his fellow All-Stars performed, he was easily the best player on the floor by nature of his enthusiasm and desire to destroy the world. Every time that Westbrook had the ball, he had his eye on complete and total domination. In the end, it earned him the 2016 All-Star Game MVP, joining four-time MVP Bob Pettit as the only back-to-back winners in All-Star Game history.Feelin' it    \nOn Sunday night, the NBA began to bid farewell for real to Kobe Bryant.

How much better would he be?When CP3 throwing you ally's instead of Norris Cole Chris Paul keeps throwing these lobs to Anthony Davis like he wants Doc to put a call into New Orleans\nDavis' statistics have plateaued and his team is struggling, but he's only one guy. It's an old debate. Golden State's Stephen Curry is on top of the world right now, but would he be without Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green?\nOklahoma City's Kevin Durant has Russell Westbrook (and vice versa). In Cleveland, LeBron James has Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Kawhi Leonard has an army of San Antonio Spurs.\u00a0\nThe best Davis has today is, um, Jrue Holiday?

The West surpassed that with about eight minutes to play in the game.\n - Jon Krawczynski\n ---\n 10:35 p.m.\n It might be time soon for some defense at the All-Star game.\n The game is headed to the fourth quarter, the only time players usually put any effort into stopping anyone in this spectacle that otherwise is all offense, all the time.\n The West leads 145-136 after a big third quarter from Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook, who scored 14 of his 22 points. He was the MVP of last year's game in New York, when his 41 points were one shy of the All-Star Game record held by Wilt Chamberlain.\n Paul George leads the East with 32.

Playing in his 18th and final All-Star game, Bryant has made 4 of 8 shots.\n He had a memorable one-on-one showdown with James in the second quarter. LeBron slapped the floor on defense in front of him as the crowd cheered, but Bryant missed a tough fallaway jumper.\n - Jon Krawczynski\n ---\n 9:05 p.m.\n After one quarter of the All-Star Game, the Eastern Conference leads the Western Conference 43-40.\n Kobe Bryant and LeBron James never met in an NBA Finals, so they squared off another way - they took the opening tap against one another, with Bryant winning.\n The East starters all took turns guarding Bryant in the opening minutes, even though ''guarding'' is a relative term in an All-Star Game.\n Dwyane Wade and James re-enacted some of their former Miami Heat hijinks, teaming up for an alley-oop dunk in the opening moments. They could have had another spectacular one midway through the quarter, but James couldn't finish after a snazzy high bounce pass from Wade.\n Paul George leads all scorers with 14 points for the East.

Bryant said he's ''been extremely fortunate to play the game I love and be in the NBA for more than half my life.''\n He ended his remarks by saying, ''Thank you so much - and now I've got to go get loose.''\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 7:55 p.m.\n Count Eastern Conference All-Star guard Dwyane Wade among those still raving about Saturday night's dunk contest finale between eventual winner Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon.\n Wade says he heard plenty of people say that it was the best contest ever, and the Heat guard says, ''I'm starting to think it was.''\n Wade was once a very explosive dunker, and says he couldn't even imagine how LaVine and Gordon came up with some of the dunks they executed on Saturday night. He says people will talk about that matchup for a long time.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 5:15 p.m.\n Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the annual Legends Brunch on Sunday.\n Robertson got the award from fellow Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and  rookie Karl-Anthony Towns - the newly crowned skills challenge winner at All-Star weekend.\n The brunch was hosted by the National Basketball Retired Players Association.\n Robertson is a past president of the players' association. In his remarks Sunday he urged the NBA's current players to study the history of how past players fought for certain rights ''and look where you are today.''\n Johnson said Robertson is one of his heroes, and Towns raved about the chance to share the stage with the ''Big O.''\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 2:15 p.m.\n After outlasting Aaron Gordon in what many believe was the best slam dunk contest in All-Star weekend history, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Zach LaVine posted a touching tribute to the late Flip Saunders on his Instagram and Twitter accounts.\n Saunders, the Timberwolves president and coach, died suddenly from Hodgkins lymphoma just days before the season started. Saunders drafted LaVine 13th overall two years ago despite the young guard playing only one season as a bench player at UCLA.\n LaVine posted a photo of his dunk championship trophy resting on a black Timberwolves jersey. The name ''FLIP'' was written across the back and LaVine's No. 8 was rotated horizontally to mimic an infinity sign.\n ''I dedicate this dunk contest and the trophy to my late coach, Flip Saunders and the Saunders family,'' LaVine wrote. ''He's the one that always believed in me and drafted me! We all loved Flip and his memory will love on forever!''\n - Jon Krawczynski"},

Bryant thanked fans who have given him more than 30 million votes in his career, and as he finished speaking all the All-Stars lined up in the background to salute him.\n He took the opening jump ball against James - neither team had a true center voted to the starting lineup - and each East starter took a turn early covering Bryant.\n Toronto hosted the very first NBA game on Nov. 1, 1946.

{"url": "http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/paul-george-punctuates-comeback-with-41-in-all-star-game-021516", "text": "\n TORONTO (AP) So many of 's All-Star teammates and opponents were on the floor 18 months ago, the night his career was put in peril by a gruesome leg injury in a scrimmage with USA Basketball.\n It has been a long, difficult road back to the rising star he was before a bone in his right leg popped through his skin on that August night in Las Vegas. Surrounded by so many of those elite faces again in Toronto on Sunday night, George has never looked more like the player that has made the  relevant again. Truth be told, he looked even better.\n George led all players with 41 points and made nine 3-pointers in the East's 196-173 loss to West, finishing one basket shy of breaking Wilt Chamberlain's single-game All-Star scoring record.\n ''For me to be here just being back as an All-Star was special. But to be able to put on a show and have fun and enjoy this moment, get back to playing how I play pre-injury is special,'' George said. ''I've just been blessed. I'm very thankful and very grateful.''\n Oklahoma City guard Russell Westbrook won the MVP award with 31 points in the victory, but it was George who stood out above all of the game's best players, just like he did before his right leg awkwardly hit the basketball stanchion in that USA scrimmage, bringing tears to his teammates' eyes.\n ''I had a hard-fought summer, hard-fought rehab year,'' George said. ''It was just a very upward climb. It took every day and really every moment of rehab to get through it. There were a lot of days where I felt like I was down and out, but just stayed with it.''\n Thanks to George's emergence as one of the NBA's bright young stars, the Pacers had climbed up the Eastern Conference ladder to assert themselves as legitimate challengers. George had a great chance to be in Team USA's plans for the London Olympics, but his leg snapped grotesquely and had many, including George himself, wondering if he would ever play again.\n He missed all but six games last season, but his ability to return even for the end of the season was a shock in and of itself. Playing in those games gave him a chance to get a little bit of confidence back, to believe that returning to basketball's highest level was possible, and he took off like a rocket at the start of this season.\n While he was injured, George worked on two of his game's weaknesses - ball-handling and perimeter shooting. He returned this season a more well-rounded player and averaged 29.5 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists in the first month of the season. Those numbers have dipped expectedly as the season has worn on, but George has his swagger back.\n ''He's back,'' Pelicans star Anthony Davis said. ''The way he shoots the ball, the way he attacks the rim, his game is very unique. Basically he was showing guys tonight that he's back to rare form.''\n On a night where all eyes started on Lakers star Kobe Bryant in his 18th and final All-Star game, they couldn't help but drift on to George as the shots kept falling and the ball kept finding him.\n Both teams broke the previous record for points in a game, with the West eclipsing the previous mark with eight minutes to go in the fourth quarter. Defense wasn't an afterthought, it was never even considered - except in the final 30 seconds.\n Sitting on 41 points, George had the ball on the right wing, needing one bucket to surpass Chamberlain's mark set in 1962. That's when Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green got right in George's face, hounding him all over the court in the only possession of defense played the entire game.\n ''We don't want any records like that broken on us,'' Green said with a chuckle. ''Just trying to contest the shot.''\n ---\n Follow Jon Krawczynski on Twitter: http://twitter.com/APKrawczynski"},

They pulled off dunks that defied description and at some points gravity.\nBut for all the hype their performances generated the NBA needs to do away with the contest for the sake of the players. Stick with me here.\nIt's getting tougher and tougher for players to impress the fans and judges during these contests. Contestants are using props, teammates and even mascots to up the ante.\nBut as they continue to raise the bar, the probability for injury also increases.\nTake for example Gordon's phenomenal \"sit-down\" dunk that amazed virtually everyone. The  forward was in the seated position some 10 feet in the air while leaping over a mascot.\" was the winner...but  had the most impressive dunk.\" -  \nJaw- dropping, yes.

He puts a ton of torque on his back.\nYes, these guys are young so they should be fine. They won't feel a thing, right? But why risk it?\nRemember Blake Griffin's dunk over a car a few years ago? What if his foot hits the lip of the wheel well? Take a look how close he gets to hitting the car.\nPlayers feel they need to do these risky dunks because we've seen it all before. We've seen MJ take off from the free-throw line -- so LaVine has to do it while catching an alley-oop.. was straight up FLYING last night! \nI love watching these contests. It's way more thrilling -- when the contestants pull off something special --\u0080\u0093 than the All-Star Game itself. But when does enough become enough?\nNow Paul George's gruesome injury occurred in a Team USA scrimmage, so the comparison is more apples to oranges. But when these players take off from the free-throw line or leap over mascots, they're moving at the same speed and using the same force they do in games.\nDon't worry fans, the dunk contest isn't really going anywhere. The only time the league would think of doing anything drastic is if a player gets seriously hurt. And we all hope it never gets to that point."},

We know this by watching the King in action and, well, through his own words. He also respects others who boast obviously high basketball IQs -- like  and 2016 Western Conference All-Star coach Gregg Popovich.\nListening to James talk about Popovich, as he did Friday during an All-Star media session from Toronto, you get the feeling that he never would have gained the reputation as a coach killer if he had played his whole career for the only NBA coach that Tim Duncan has ever answered to in 19 seasons.LeBron has some serious Pop love  \nJames is the only player to hand Popovich a loss in six NBA Finals appearances. The two future Hall of Famers are 1-1 against each other, splitting the 2013 and 2014 championship series. They'll go against each again during Sunday's NBA All-Star Game.\nAre criticisms that James has a history of undermining his head coaches fair? It's hard to argue that it's never been the case. But when you think you're smarter than your boss, it can be hard to keep your mouth shut. And it's hard to argue that James hasn't thought of himself as smarter than most, if not all, of his coaches ().\"What do you guys want me to do, turn my brain off because I have a huge basketball IQ?\" James told reporters following the firing of coach David Blatt when asked about the perception that he had a hand in the organization's decision. \"If that's what they want me to do, I'm not going to do it because I've got so much to give to the game. There's no difference for me telling my teammates or telling guys how to get better with their game. If I feel I got something that will help our team, ultimately, I like to give it. It helped me get two titles.\"So, but I think it does suck that people want to throw my name in dirt for no particular reason, because of speculation or whatever the case may be. But you can't worry about it too much. I got 14 guys here. I got a fan base here and a fan base all over the world that loves what I do, and they respect what I do, and I can't worry about a select group of people that wants to use their negative energy to take away my positive energy. I can't allow that to happen.\"\nPopovich has never had to worry about that, which is a testament to his basketball brain and the relationships he's forged with his players, as well as a function of the selfless players he's coached. From David Robinson to Duncan to Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili to Kawhi Leonard, none of those players ever viewed themselves as bigger than the team, or smarter than the coach.\nHad Pat Riley not had that bag of championship rings to dump in front of James, one can only wonder how long Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra might have lasted after an initial rough start.\nIn Cleveland, David Blatt didn't make it to his second All-Star break despite a Finals appearance and leading the Eastern Conference this season. Otherwise, he, and not Tyronn Lue, would have been up against Pop on Sunday night as the coach of the East All-Stars.\n\u00a0"},

For Bryant to prepare his body to play, it literally takes a village of trainers, massage therapists, physical therapists and nutritionists.\nIn a recent article, , delved into Bryant's complex regimen that is designed to keep his body as healthy as possible for his retirement tour season.\nHere's how Holmes describes a portion of that regimen:It all begins with a dedicated army of physical therapists, massage therapists and trainers that battles daily to keep him upright with methods both high-tech and low-grade. A mini jackhammer known as the Raptor, which came on the market in December 2015, is used to blast through Bryant's scar tissue at 3,600 percussions per minute, to shake his muscles awake. A vibrating foam roller known as the Vyper, first available in 2014, helps his sore muscles relax. Before every game, a soup made from bone broth rebuilds his battered joint surfaces. After the final buzzer, a low-sugar chocolate milk aids his muscle and tissue recovery.If there's time before a game or after, Bryant's Fusionetics therapist, Michael Oviedo, who blends preventative therapy with cutting-edge technology, completes a 10-point range-of-motion assessment, from big toe to shoulder. Using something called a goniometer, Oviedo measures whether Bryant's ankles bend at least 20 degrees, the optimal target; if they don't, Oviedo massages the soft tissue around the guard's ankles and into his calves, relaxing the muscles until he can move as desired. As Oviedo takes measurements, he punches his findings into the Fusionetics app on his iPad, which spits back suggestions on treatment.At every turn, Bryant is stretched, kneaded and evaluated, sometimes by his own neuromuscular therapist, or one of his two chiropractors, or his \"active-release\" therapist, or one of his several \"stretch professionals,\" or his personal strength and conditioning trainer.\nThe Lakers are happy to provide Bryant with whatever care he needs. As Holmes explains, it's not just to make Bryant happy in his final season, but also for the Lakers' benefit. Bryant provides one of the only real reasons to watch this Lakers team, which sits at the bottom of the Western Conference standings. With a mammoth local television deal in place, the Lakers need eyeballs to stay tuned in.\nHere's how Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak described this all-Kobe-all-the-time season to Holmes:\"Every game, it's about Kobe. Even when he doesn't play, it's about Kobe.\"\nEven when Bryant is nowhere near at the capabilities he once possessed, he remains L.A.'s one and only showstopper. The Lakers will do whatever they can to keep on the court for the next two months.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"},

It wasn't enough.\nNow everybody who pays attention to the NBA wonders if the rest of the league has enough to prevent Stephen Curry and company from breaking Michael Jordan's 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' record 72 wins in a single season. As improbable as it seemed that any team would ever reach 70 wins again, the Warriors' pursuit of 73 seems not only possible, but almost plausible, as the league reached All-Star Weekend.\nThe Warriors need to finish the season 25-5 to get to 73 wins. Through 52 games, they've gone 48-4. The 95-96 Bulls were 47-5 after 52 games.\nJames, asked about Golden State's chances to do it, told reporters on Saturday, :\"Records are meant to be broken, so it is possible.\"\nJames said the Warriors' great depth, and the ability of players up and down the roster to accept their roles, has them positioned to make history.\"I think they've used last year to take them to a new height,\" James said. \"Obviously with Steph and Draymond and Klay they spearhead the whole thing, but everybody else, from Iggy (Finals MVP Andre Iguodala) to (Leandro) Barbosa to (Harrison) Barnes to (Andrew) Bogut, all the way down, those guys fall into place. They know their role, they know what they need to do every single night.\"They play their roles individually as how they should play. And they don't step outside that box and that's what makes them so great.\"\nThe Warriors, who entered the All-Star break on an 11-game win streak, have talked more and more openly about going for the record. And they should. Seasons like this don't happen all the time, obviously. Those '95-96 Bulls are the only one team in history to win at least 70 games.

It's hard to remember now that when Bryant opted to enter the NBA straight out of high school in 1996, it was a controversial decision.\nIt's even harder to remember that he didn't exactly burst onto the NBA scene. He averaged just 15.5 minutes as a rookie under then-Lakers coach Del Harris. And it wasn't until his third season that Bryant became a full-time starter.\u00a0\nLooking back on it, Bryant told reporters during Saturday's All-Star media session in Toronto that he made the right decision to enter the NBA straight of high school. In fact, he said of the decision\u00a0that made him the first-ever guard taken out of high school\u00a0that it was the best one he made of his 20-year career.\u00a0:\"The best decision (I ever made was) coming straight to the NBA and skipping college. That's it \u2013 the best one.\"\nPlayers such as Bryant, Kevin Garnett and LeBron James successfully made the jump from high school to the NBA. However, since 2006, the league has had in place a rule that forces players to be out of high school for at least one year before entering the NBA Draft.\u00a0\nPlayers who likely could have jumped straight to the NBA such as Kevin Durant and Andrew Wiggins, instead spent one year at college. Durant went to Texas and Wiggins spent one season at Kansas. Denver Nuggets point guard Emmanuel Mudiay actually bypassed college and played one season in China.\nBryant said forcing players to go to college, or elsewhere, for a year isn't exactly fair, but he also cautioned that making the leap to the NBA from high school isn't for everybody.\"You have high school players that go to college, stay for four years and come out and they're not ready; you got certain high school players that skip college and they're ready. So I think it depends on the mentors that you have, it depends on the internal motivation or spirit of the kid himself. Ultimately it depends on the teachers that you have and the mentors that you have. You can go to college for four years and get horrible mentorship and be worse off than a kid who came to the league at 17.\"\nIt is interesting that Bryant believes his decision to enter the draft straight of high school was his best decision, as opposed perhaps to his decision to stay with the Lakers and call off his demand for a trade in 2007. Can anybody right about now imagine Bryant retiring in any other uniform than Lakers' gold and purple?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"},

But when asked if he felt the 2016 Verizon Slam Dunk contest was the best dunk contest ever, LaVine didn\u2019t hesitate to offer a candid take in his post-victory elation.\n\u201cYeah, and I don't want to get into -- everybody's probably going to say something about Mike and all them and Dr. J. But in my personal opinion, man, we did some things that nobody else did,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cLike half the dunks we did were like professional-dunker dunks, and it takes them four or five times to try it and make it, and we did it on the first try.\n\u201cIt was crazy. In my opinion, yes.\u201d\nLaVine\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d is right. This was the best dunk contest ever, and, frankly, this was the best All-Star Saturday Night ever, too.\nThe NBA\u2019s All-Star Saturday Night has lost its buzz over the past few years, if not the last decade. The Slam Dunk Contest has progressively gotten less entertaining as fewer stars participated and the creativity waned, and fans have never really been interested in the Shooting Stars Competition -- which was removed this year -- or Skills Challenge to begin with. The 3-Point Shootout is hit or miss -- you either find it intriguing, or you don\u2019t really care for it.\nBut Saturday, Feb. 13, 2016, that all changed.\nThe Skills Challenge was a relative success. The competition was setup with guards on one side of the bracket, and big men on the other side -- ensuring there would be a big man in the finals -- which made things more interesting than in years past. Watching speedy and athletic guards navigate an obstacle course became boring; watching slower big men do it, though, is fresh, exciting and unintentionally hilarious.\nIsaiah Thomas, the heavy favorite, predictably made the finals. His opponent, rookie big man sensation Karl-Anthony Towns, was unexpected and might\u2019ve been the slowest and least athletic competitor in the field. But Towns pulled off the upset, and the group of four big men -- Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins and Towns -- celebrated a skills victory over their smaller counterparts.\nIt was fun and entertaining and lighthearted, the way it should be. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but it was certainly the most memorable Skill Challenge in recent memory.\nAnd the events only got better from there.\nThe 3-point contest between Draymond Green and actor/comedian/four-time Celebrity Game MVP Kevin Hart went as well as it could\u2019ve. Green won the shootout, 12-11, as Hart\u2019s last-second make to tie Green didn\u2019t count as it was ruled after the buzzer -- and saved the gimmick, which served as an appetizer for the real 3-Point Shootout, from being ruined.\nHad Green made a few more shots, or Hart not gotten hot at the end, it would\u2019ve simply been a pointless spectacle. But instead, it was a surprisingly competitive competition, and Hart -- who\u2019s become nothing more than a self-promoting sideshow the past few All-Star Weekends -- actually proved he\u2019s got some game, hitting actual NBA 3-pointers (his foot was on the line for about half of his attempts).Quote of the night: \"At least you lost to Klay, I almost lost to Kevin Hart.\" -  to  \nSpeaking of shooting, the 3-Point Shootout was arguably the best it\u2019s ever been as well. Five of the eight contestants finished with 20 or more points (which is usually the high, not the average) in the first round, resulting in a three-way tie for third place. Rookie Devin Booker downed J.J. Redick and James Harden, earning a much-deserved trip to the final round to face \u2026 the Splash Brothers.\nPoor guy. We all knew how that was going to turn out.\nStephen Curry went before Klay Thompson (the leader in the first round), finishing with 23 points, a high mark by any measure. Thompson looked like he was going to fall to his MVP teammate in back-to-back seasons, only to catch fire on the last two racks and finish with 27 points -- tied for the most ever with Curry in 2015, because, of course.\n3-point shooting has never been more prevalent than it is in today\u2019s game, and this year\u2019s 3-point contest reflected that with the Splash Bros and a field of worthy challengers.\nThe dunk contest, the annual highlight of the entire All-Star Weekend, didn\u2019t look that enticing at first, as it featured defending champion LaVine, the stunning favorite, and three somewhat unconventional choices.\nAndre Drummond is a first-time All-Star and a rising star, but he\u2019s far from a household name for now, and isn\u2019t necessarily known for creative dunks. Will Barton has been a rotation player for about a year. Aaron Gordon, a former lottery pick and the breakout star of the night, has toiled in obscurity in Orlando amid a lack of playing time and several injuries.\nLaVine looked like a lock to repeat as a back-to-back champion.\nYet Gordon won the night by going dunk-for-dunk with LaVine, combining for an insane six straight 50-point dunks during a double-overtime dunk-off (which has to be some sort of unofficial record). Six 50s in the 6ix. It was only right.\nGordon had the dunk of the night -- somehow bringing the ball under both legs as he practically sat down mid-air and then slamming it over the Magic\u2019s mascot, Stuff The Magic Dragon -- and many felt he was robbed. Those people are right. But anyone clamoring for LaVine -- who dunked from the free-throw line three times, including once between-his-legs -- to have won was right, too.\nIt was just amazing, and worth all the hyperbole it\u2019s since received. A top-3 dunk contest at the least, but probably the best one ever given the creativity, versatility and competitiveness both dunkers displayed.The dunk contest is back!!!\nThe dunk contest is back for the time being. Hopefully we can get LaVine-Gordon II, but if not, perhaps this duel -- and the reaction it caused -- will inspire better dunkers to join the competition next season and in the years to come.\nThe dunk contest had become such a taboo topic recently that it made sense why few stars have wanted to participate -- they\u2019d be ridiculed regardless of their performance, in most cases. But this proved that, with the right field and the right dunks, people can still love the dunk contest, and that\u2019s as big of a victory as any during All-Star Weekend.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t improvements to be made. A one-on-one competition, a (real) Horse competition, and an old timer\u2019s game are all events that could supplement the weekend, and any of those three ideas -- among many others -- would be improvements over the vanilla Skills Challenge.\nBut assuming everything stays relatively the same for the next few years, as it has now for over a decade (the Skills Challenge was implemented in 2002), the 2016 All-Star Saturday night was an overwhelming success.\nThe dunk contest is back. All-Star Weekend is back. And that\u2019s all you can ask for.\n"},

So much so that he once tried to get Nowitzki to play for the Lakers.\nBryant doesn't say when it was that he made the pitch to Nowitzki, but the summer of 2010 makes sense.\u201cDirk and I have always had a great relationship because we\u2019re both extremely competitive and also both extremely loyal to our teams.\u00a0I\u2019ll tell you a story about Dirk. He was up for free agency. And I knew what his response was gonna be, but just out of respect, I said \u2018Dude, everybody\u2019s looking around, all these free agents, I thought I\u2019d just shoot you a text if you wanna come to LA.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018Dude, I would love to play with you, but Dallas is my home, this is my team, I\u2019m not leaving here.\u2019 So he and I think a lot alike in that regard.\u201d\nNowitzki was a free agent and coming off an ugly first-round playoff loss to the San Antonio Spurs. It was coach Rick Carlisle's second season and the way it ended seemed to leave .\nEven  after that playoff loss, saying: Dallas \"was always my plan\" but insisted that \"I just have to keep my options open at this point.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps that's when Bryant, who had just won a fifth championship, and two in a row partnered with Pau Gasol, that he might have brought up the idea of Nowitzki coming to sunny L.A.\nWith Gasol and Nowitzki playing alongside Bryant, it would have arguably combined the two best international big men in the game. And it might have worked, considering Gasol could work the low block while Nowitzki roamed the perimeter.\nAnd with Bryant being the ultimate offensive threat, who would defenses double-team? Nowitzki could have had a field day playing off Bryant.\nBut like Bryant said, Nowitzki has never had any real interest in leaving Dallas. In fact, the next season it was Nowitzki and the Mavs who ended the Lakers' three-peat quest with a second-round sweep that launched Dallas to its first-ever title. Now in his 18th season, Nowitzki remains the franchise's best player, keeping another revamped roster in the playoff conversation.\u00a0\nNot even Nowitzki with this Lakers team could likely get Bryant back to the postseason one last time."},

The  star has been selected to the All-Star Game 18 times in his 20-year career, only missing out on a nomination in his rookie season, before he'd become a superstar, and because of the 1998-99 lockout, which wiped that season's festivities off the calendar.\nInjury has prevented Bryant from playing in three of those 18 All-Star Games. But even in those instances, the future Hall of Famer dominated the buildup to the game, with talk of who would replace Kobe the only socially acceptable basketball conversation from January until mid-February.\nFor nearly 20 years, then, the All-Star Game and Kobe Bryant have been synonymous. He took the microphone and led the league through its biggest (non-playoff) showcase year after year. When the NBA needed someone to pick up the pieces of the post-Jordan era, it was Bryant who trash-talked Jordan on his way out and stepped up to fill the void:\nWhen LeBron James wasn't quite ready to show the world how truly clutch he was, it was Bryant who told The King that true royalty doesn't pass:\nWhen the most important storyline in the league was the continued rivalry between Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, the Black Mamba once again put on a show, complete with seemingly scripted reconciliation:\nEven when it was clear that Bryant's best days were behind him and the NBA belonged to LeBron, it was still Kobe who made sure fans got what they wanted \u2014 just a few minutes of a rivalry between the two that never was:\nAnd, yes, when Bryant's retirement tour makes its weekend-long stop in Toronto, it's once again Bryant we'll be watching. There's simply no other way.\u00a0No other player has meant more for this specific game through the years.\nWere it not for that aforementioned lockout, Bryant would be tied with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for most All-Star selections in NBA history at 19. Abdul-Jabbar gets that one on a technicality, but that's the only place where anyone can claim All-Star supremacy over Kobe. Michael Jordan? Bryant's already played in more All-Star games (15 heading into Sunday) than Jordan had selections (14). Jordan meant more to the league as a whole, but his dominance both on and off the court was about a crushing, inescapable feeling of an inevitable Bulls win. The All-Star Game was just a break from destroying opponents' souls.\nBryant's a four-time All-Star Game MVP, equaled by Hall of Famer Bob Pettit. And with apologies to Mr. Pettit, we have to say we're more impressed by Bryant's litany of awards, if only because the star power seems significantly higher these days. To our fans of '50s and '60s NBA, we apologize for the slight.\nBryant has the most consecutive All-Star selections \u2014 all 18 times have been in a row, of course \u2014 and on Sunday will add to his record for most All-Star starts, chalking up number 16 in Toronto. He'll also add to his All-Star record 280 points, although we wouldn't be completely surprised to see Bryant try (and fail) to make a run at Magic Johnson's record of 22 assists in a single All-Star game.\nIt's impossible to run through the list of NBA All-Star records and not have Bryant's name jump out at you. We could keep going and going: One more steal and he'll surpass Michael Jordan for most career All-Star steals (unless, of course, you count his selection to the 2016 game as a robbery, in which case the mark is already his). Most tellingly -- and least surprisingly -- Bryant holds the record for most career baskets (115) in the All-Star Game. Capping it off with a nice, round 130 total FGs after Sunday would be a great way to end the night.\nThere are a number of amazing stars on display in the 2016 All-Star Game. Stephen Curry is the present and the future. LeBron James reigns in Cleveland. Jimmy Butler is the next heir to Jordan in Chicago. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook are just fine with their quiet status as underdogs in OKC, but they won't mind taking the opportunity to remind everyone just how good they are on Sunday.\nNone of it matters \u2014 not really, anyway.\u00a0The game has seen countless legends and moments throughout the years. They've all played second fiddle in February to Kobe. Whether by the numbers or by the memories, the NBA All-Star Game belongs to Bryant. Without him, the very idea of the game doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\u00a0\nAnd for that reason, 2017 is sure to be weird."},

I'm beginning to feel that a change needs to be made. And that comes in response to conversations with our network partners. It comes in response to fan data that we look at. We're constantly surveying our fans to get their sense of what they see out on the floor. I'm talking to players and general managers, and our owners of course.''\n Change would be difficult, because though some coaches say they hate using the strategy, they clearly believe it can be effective. Silver said league data shows it is being used at a 5 1/2 times greater rate than last season.\n Mostly used on Shaquille O'Neal when he played, coaches now find Houston's , Detroit's  and the Clippers'  to be targets. And though it slows the game and has drawn more criticism this season as techniques such as jumping on a player's back during a free throw or fouling an inbounds passer have increased, nobody seems to have a good solution.\n Silver said a rule change would require approval by 20 of the league's 30 teams.\n ''So we're nowhere near that point where we're even starting to count heads,'' Silver said. ''And I think there is a reason when the constitution and bylaws were written of the NBA that those founders decided that it should take two-thirds of teams to change a rule. I think it should be a very deliberate process, you know, and nothing should be done harshly, which is why I'm not in favor of changing the rule midseason.''\n So he believes owners will consider it at their April meeting with the hope of having something to vote on during their July meeting."},

''This is bigger than me. This is for all the bigs out there, with the game changing the way it is, to show that bigs can stand up with guards and skillwise.''\n It's been four years since the NBA decided to eliminate the center position on the All-Star ballot in response to the dearth of talent at the position and the evolution of the game from post-centric offenses to pace and space.\n With his ability to handle the ball, shoot the 3 and make the extra pass, Towns is the epitome of the improving big man. But heading into the competition, there were doubts that the big fellas could keep up with the small fries.

''I was able to make critics wrong, Vegas wrong, Ricky Rubio wrong. So I'm just so ecstatic right now.''\n The course required players to weave through some obstacles, throw a pass through a target, dribble the length of the court for a layup and then make a 3-pointer.\n After Towns hoisted the trophy, Green, Davis and Cousins joined him on the podium to celebrate.\n It's already been a banner weekend for the young Wolves.

The Hall of Fame big man was the only judge to give Gordon a 9:Oh okay Aaron Gordon!   \nIt seemed as if it might be some Orlando-themed heckling, until the Big Diesel repeated his harsh judgment on LaVine's impressive second dunk:Oh man oh man!  When  doesn't give out 10s... \nWhat, did O'Neal have a quota of just one perfect score to give out during the night? Or did he just feel the need to play the contrarian?

LaVne captured his second straight dunk title - and a second trophy in two nights in Toronto.\n ''I had to bring my A-plus-plus-plus game,'' LaVine said.\n The 3-point crown stayed by the Bay - though with the other `Splash Brother.' Klay Thompson pulled off a smooth-shooting surprise by beating Stephen Curry to win the 3-point title.\n ''Back-to-back years for Splash Brothers, it's pretty cool,'' Thompson said.\n All-Star weekend so far has belonged to LaVine and the , as rookie Karl-Anthony Towns showed big guys have skills, too.\n The night - and the first two nights of this first All-Star weekend held outside the U.S. - has ended with a celebration for LaVine, who won the MVP award in Friday's Rising Stars Challenge for rookies and second-year players.\n He outlasted Gordon in a duel that needed two overtimes and ended only when there was literally no ball to use. Curry batted it down to other end of the court after he and the other NBA stars who were as captivated as the fans and celebrities sitting courtside charged onto the court when LaVine leaped from just inside the free throw line, put the ball between his legs in midair and slammed it down.\n He and Gordon traded perfect scores of 50 for the previous few rounds after advancing to the final, but the Orlando Magic rookie mustered only a 47 in his last attempt.\n But he may have had the most memorable dunks of the night with some help from the Magic's mascot - aptly named Stuff the Magic Dragon.\n On Stuff's first assist, Gordon took the ball with one hand from the mascot, who was spinning around on a hoverboard, and did a 360-degree dunk. He got another assist from Stuff on the next one, leaping high to take the ball, putting it under his legs - nearly in a sitting position in midair - and slamming it down with his left hand.\n ''Me and him are now like best friends, me and Stuff,'' Gordon said.\n A night that included an appearance by boxing ring announcer Michael Buffer ended with a couple heavyweight matchups. LaVine became the first repeat dunk champion since Nate Robinson, but Curry wasn't even the best on his own team after setting a final-round record last year.\n This time, Thompson was so good he had clinched it even before the final ball on his final rack. He started to walk away after making first four - then turned and made that one, anyway.\n ''He definitely shot well tonight,'' Curry said. ''I still think I can hold my own in the competition, but the way that he finished off that second round was amazing. So trust me, the pressure of knowing what number he had to hit and making five out of five was fun to watch.''\n Towns beat Boston Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas to win the Skills Challenge, further validating the evolution of the big man from a plodding post player to a playmaking force.\n In the first year that frontcourt players were allowed to compete against the guards in the event that combines dribbling, passing and perimeter shooting, Towns beat Golden State's Draymond Green and Sacramento's DeMarcus Cousins in the big men side of the bracket before edging Thomas in the finals.\n ''I'm glad I was able to help the bigs come out with this trophy,'' said Towns, the No. 1 overall pick in the June draft. ''This is bigger than me. This is for all the bigs out there, with the game changing the way it is, to show that bigs can stand up with guards and skillwise.''"},

Thompson finished the final round with 27 points, four more than Curry managed as once again, the title came down to the two Golden State sharpshooters.\n ''We love to shoot against each other,'' Thompson said. ''You know, I've never been on a team with someone who shoots it better than me, so it's a privilege to work with him every day. He makes me that much better.''\n Phoenix's Devin Booker was third, with 16 points in the final round. He beat Houston's James Harden and J.J. Redick of the Los Angeles Clippers to get out of the first round, and Toronto's Kyle Lowry, Portland's C.J. McCollum and Milwaukee's Khris Middleton were eliminated early.\n As probably many expected, it came down to Curry and Thompson.\n Curry shot before Thompson in the final round, making his first seven shots and putting up 23 points - which, to that point, was the best score of the night. Shooters got one point for making a conventional 3-pointer, two points for using a multicolored ''money ball.''\n ''At the end of the day, you've got to make shots,'' Curry said. ''Just like in a game.''\n So the pressure was on Thompson, and he delivered.\n Here's how good Thompson was in the finals - he had two different streaks of eight consecutive makes. Thompson was 19-for-25 in the final round, 18-for-25 in the first, and adding them together put him at 74 percent on the night.\n That's what it took to beat Curry, who set the NBA single-season record with 286 3-pointers last season and is on pace to obliterate that mark this season. He's already at 245, and the  have 30 games remaining.\n And really, the only title Curry probably really wants to defend is the NBA championship anyway. He and Thompson have helped the Warriors get off to a 48-4 start this season, making them the heavy favorites to repeat as titlists.\n ''Back-to-back years for the `Splash Brothers,''' Thompson said. ''It's pretty cool.''"},

Another bout with the leukemia he's been battling for the last few years resurfaced, and Sager was forced to sit out while undergoing more treatments.\n Sager considers the All-Star festivities the most important weekend of the season for him, and so it pained him to have to watch on television while receiving his treatments.\n ''It was hard for me not to be there, but I had to address my health,'' Sager said. ''To be able to get that in remission and be able to go through this year, it's going to be extra special for me. I've really been looking forward to this a long time.''\n That's right. Sager is back for All-Star weekend in Toronto this year.\n He spent the week leading up to it in Houston receiving his monthly treatment, which included a blood transfusion, to make sure he was healthy enough for the trip. Once he arrived in Canada, he was easy to spot.\n ''I just saw him,''  coach and longtime foil Gregg Popovich said after the Western Conference team practiced on Saturday. ''His suit spoke to me. It blinded me for a second.''\n It's been an emotional run for Sager, the longtime fixture at NBA games. He has needed two bone marrow transplants and still has to make those treks to Houston once a month. He has returned to the sideline for games this season and is feeling so well that he was scheduled to do both the Saturday night activities that include the 3-point shootout and the dunk contest as well as the game on Sunday.\n ''I feel great. Got my weight back. Got my strength back,'' Sager said. ''I'm back to playing golf.''\n Two of his youngest children - daughter Riley and son Ryan - will be with him on the court this weekend serving as a ball boy and ball girl.\n And of course, Sager will do a round with Popovich on television during a quarter break on Sunday. The two have turned the sideline interview into a passion play,\n ''He's been an iconic figure in the NBA. He does a great job,'' Popovich said. ''His sense of humor is obvious. we have a lot of fun going back and forth with that. To have him back where he belongs, obviously we're happy for him and his health. But for the league it's great too, because he's a fixture that everybody enjoys.''\n Sager called the support he has received from Commissioner Adam Silver, coaches, players and fans ''humbling'' and said he was looking forward to coming back to his favorite event of the season.\n ''It's been very uplifting, very therapeutic,'' Sager said. ''Very supportive on their part. That really has been very helpful to me, my treatment and my drive to get back.''"},

He and  are the first pair of teammates to win consecutive NBA Three-Point Contests.\n\"Just the fact I got to go up against Steph in the finals again,\" Thompson said, when asked what he'd cherish about this victory the most. \"It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Not gonna lie, I got nervous when he hit his first [seven in the final round], and I didn't think he was going to miss. But it was exciting, just coming back to Oakland [with the title], you know. Back-to-back years for Splash Brothers, it's pretty cool.\"\nEight participants began the contest, and the players with the top three first-round scores advanced. The third was 19-year-old Suns rookie Devin Booker, who bested James Harden and J.J. Redick in a tiebreaker round to battle the Golden State duo for the title.\nThere's no doubting Curry's greatness as a shooter, and Thompson knows this as well as anyone, because he sees it on a daily basis. He acknowledged the fact that Curry being less than amazing played a part in his victory, despite what ultimately proved to be a record-tying performance.\n\"You know, he's the best shooter I've ever seen, so this is a rare occurrence that he loses,\" Thompson said. \"So I'm just happy I caught him on an off night.\"\nHere's how good Thompson was in the finals: He had two different streaks of eight consecutive makes. Thompson was 19 for 25 in the final round, 18 for 25 in the first, and adding them together put him at 74 percent on the night.\nThat's what it took to beat Curry, who set the NBA single-season record with 286 3-pointers last season and is on pace to obliterate that mark this season. He's already at 245, and the Warriors have 30 games remaining.\n\"At the end of the day, you've got to make shots,\" Curry said. \"Just like in a game.\"\n"},

Ain't nothing left,\" LaVine said. \"I just found a little piece of dust.\"\nLaVine pulled off a between-the-legs dunk from the free throw line on the second tie-breaker to take home his second straight dunk contest trophy, joining Michael Jordan, Jason Richardson and Nate Robinson as the only back-to-back winners.Zach LaVine seals the deal!  \nThe  guard had never tried the dunk before. Not in practice. Not at that playgrounds back home in Seattle. But he had already used all four of the dunks he planned to do when fellow contestant Will Barton told him to try it.\nHe pulled it off, putting an emphatic punctuation on a contest that instantly drew comparisons to the showdown between Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins in 1988.\n\"I just think that was the best contest,\" LaVine said. \"There was some stuff that's never been done before. I don't want to get into the greats \u2014 Mike, they're in a different breath. If you really look at it as a whole, we were doing dunks that professional dunkers take four or five tries to do and we were doing it on the first try. It was ridiculous, man.\"\nThe night started as a coronation when on his first dunk LaVine grabbed the ball off the bounce, wrapped the ball around his back before cupping it with his right hand and threw it down. But once the contest was whittled to two contestants, Gordon put on a show every bit LaVine's equal.Like it's nothing!  Zach LaVine won't let his title slip away!  . is putting on a show \n\"I'm so happy I prepared some extras because usually you don't need them,\" LaVine said. \"People usually aren't that prepared to go up against you. But he deserved the title just as much as I did. He ... did some crazy, ridiculous dunks. I'm just glad I got the last laugh.\"\nGordon jumped over  mascot Stuff, who was standing on a hoverboard, for three of his dunks, including one in which he grabbed the ball and passed it underneath both legs before throwing it down. He also grabbed the ball out of a spinning Stuff's hand and threw down a huge 360 to open the final round.\n\"If I knew it was going to be like that, I would have prepared better and we would have been here dunking all night, going back 50 after 50 after 50 after 50,\" Gordon said. \"We would have been here all night. I didn't know it was going to be like that.\"\nThe door finally opened for LaVine when Gordon was awarded a 47 on his fourth dunk of the second round, a Harold Miner-style jackknife.\nThen LaVine shut it down.\n\"Zach's an incredible dunker,\" Gordon said. \"He went through the legs from the free-throw line. That is insane. So off that dunk, you've got to give it to him. That's why the trophy's with him and not with me.\"\nMaybe they will come back next year and do it again.\n\"In Charlotte, yeah, if they want me to come back, I probably will,\" Gordon said."},

LaVine and the Magic's Aaron Gordon apparently wanted to stay all evening. Unfortunately, when you prepare only four dunks for a contest that's supposed to go only a quartet of rounds, tacking on another two can be reasonably overwhelming.\nGordon was understandably drained of inspiration after his second-place finish. \"I don't know how many more I've got,\" he said when asked about a potential return trip to the dunk contest next season. Indeed, that's the kind of thing that happens when you make history.\nDouble-overtime had never happened before in a dunk contest. Six consecutive perfect scores (earning 10s from all five judges) had never happened either. Now, both have, and it's in large part thanks to Gordon\u2014 although an earlier finish would have been fine by him.     \n\"I was just hoping Zach was going to miss, and it wasn't going to happen,\" Gordon said. \"You could see my facial expressions when Zach dunked it. It's like, OK, that's a 50. Like, I know we're going to have to dunk again.\"\u00a0\nIt was , with rackets and nets exchanged for rims and ... well, nets. It wasn't going to end unless judge Shaquille O'Neal \u2014 harsh enough to give out some previous unpopular \"9s,\" helping LaVine and Gordon get 49s instead of 50s on their ways to the finals \u2014 reverted back to his early evening ways. O'Neal made Simon Cowell look generous early. Instead, the two finalists elevated to such sovereign levels by the end that he adapted Paula Abdul's ways quickly.\nEventually, Gordon fell in the second OT period. His score of 47 on an improvised over-the-head, below-the-legs dunk couldn't hold up to LaVine's 50 finisher from the charity stripe. That ultimate slam from LaVine came just as it seemed even he might be out of ideas.\n\"At the end of the day, we both didn't have dunks,\" LaVine said. \"He was trying to throw it off the shot clock. He was like, I've never tried that before. We were looking in our bag of tricks. Ain't nothing left. I just found a little piece of dust.\"\nStill, LaVine dunked three times from the free-throw line, including once on a one-handed, alley-oop finish from NBA vet and noted lob tosser Andre Miller. Gordon's dunks were right there with his, though.\nThe Magic forward got the crowd going early when he invited out his team's mascot, Stuff the Magic Dragon. He approached the furry, shamrock creature from behind, leapt over all 7 or 8 feet of him and finished. The Toronto crowd roared.\u00a0Some more Zach?!   \n\"Me and him are now like best friends,\" Gordon joked. \"Me and Stuff.\"\nIt wasn't even his second-best dunk of the night. It wouldn't have been LaVine's third-best.\u00a0That time Aaron Gordon pretty much SAT on the basketball mid-air then dropped the hammer? Yaah   \n\"Everybody's probably going to say something about Mike and all them and Dr. J, but in my personal opinion, man, we did something nobody else did,\" LaVine said when asked if he had just participated in the best dunk contest ever. \"Like half the dunks we did were like professional dunker dunks, and it takes them four or five times to try it and make it. And we did it on the first try. It was crazy. In my opinion, yes.\"\nEven the oft-gimmicky props \u2014 like Gordon using the second cousin of the Philly Phanatic, who stood on a hoverboard \u2014 had their purposes. Try to imagine this dunk contest without a spinning Stuff as Gordon flew past him to grab the rock with one hand and finish his third meteoric terminus of the night. It's not the same.\nLaVine took the other side. If the people who are nostalgic for the old ways of the dunk contest, for the times before there were props and overly flashy personalities weren't impressed by LaVine, the now repeat champ, then there's nothing that can outdo M.J.'s and Dominique's epic 1988 battle in their minds.\u00a0MERCY AG!   \nFor the second straight year, LaVine didn't pull out any toys. He just dunked. Then dunked again. And again.\n\"It could have gone either way,\" Gordon said. \"Zach's an incredible dunker. He went through his legs from the free-throw line. That's insane. So off that dunk, you've got to give it to him.\"\nHe went from the foul line during each overtime period. He placed a score of 50 five times. Whether Gordon was throwing the ball over his head and down to his knees on the same slam or firing over a jolly, green mascot, he was matching \u2014 up until the very end.\n\"He came with something that no one else had done,\" LaVine said of Gordon's spectacular performance. \"He did two dunks that were just crazy with the mascots, jumping over them. We just kept pushing each other until the last dunk.\"\nAs for LaVine, he doesn't think repeating as slam dunk champ is the end of him at All-Star Weekend.\n\"I want to do it all,\" he said. \"I've got the Rising Stars, the Slam Dunk.\"\nThat leaves the Skills Challenge, 3-Point Contest and actual All-Star Game for the cycle.\n\"I've got three more left,\" he said. \"I'm going to try to get them.\"\n"},

{"url": "http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/phoenix-suns-university-of-arizona-wildcats-aaron-gordon-021316", "text": "\n It was early Saturday morning.\u00a0\n,  sophomore and NBA Slam Dunk Contest participant, arrived in his hotel room.\nDespite the fact that he would compete in the drawcard event of NBA All-Star Saturday in less than 24 hours, he was more concerned about getting food than rest. Gordon wasted no time in ordering room service to feed himself, and his guests.\nAmong\u00a0the\u00a0three guests\u00a0in Gordon's suite were myself, Jason Stirman -- the CEO and co-founder of\u00a0Lucid,\u00a0a start-up that focuses\u00a0on mental skills training -- and, most importantly,\u00a0Graham Betchart.\nBefore his current role as\u00a0Director of\u00a0Mental\u00a0Training for Lucid,\u00a0Betchart played a unique role in nurturing the\u00a0Magic\u00a0forward,\u00a0long\u00a0before\u00a0his time in\u00a0the NBA.\n\"The first time I met Graham was after he did a talk,\" Gordon told FOX Sports. \"It only dawned on me recently that I met him when I was just 11 years old.\"\u00a0\n\"I was at a hot prospect camp in the East Bay, and it was just this average-looking white dude walking into the gym. I had no idea who he was.\"\nBetchart is a\u00a0proponent\u00a0of \"mindfulness,\" a\u00a0term popularized by renowned mental skills coach, George Mumford, who was a mentor for\u00a0the likes of\u00a0Michael Jordan, Kobe\u00a0Bryant, and Phil Jackson.\nEarlier, on\u00a0Friday, Betchart was with Mumford, himself. The two were liaising with one another, brainstorming ideas, in an attempt to find the best way to spread their message across the globe.\n\"When I started teaching this, and I learned that George Mumford existed -- and worked with Michael Jordan and Kobe -- that was the window to teach kids,\" Betchart said.Aaron Gordon and friends.\n\"Now I can say that the person you look up to and admire does this stuff, so if you want to be like that, let's do this. \"\nBetchart's\u00a0methods may be unorthodox, but Gordon swears by them, and his mentor has since worked with Andrew\u00a0Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns --\u00a0the two most recent No. 1 overall NBA Draft picks -- along with current college basketball stars, Ben Simmons and\u00a0Jaylen\u00a0Brown.\n\"Graham\u00a0lined everyone up\u00a0on the baseline,\" Gordon recounted.\n\"He gave us ping-pong balls, and a bucket. We started throwing the ping-pong balls into the\u00a0bucket. The idea was to breathe, then throw the Ping-Pong ball.\"\nThe game was rigged so that the ball would never\u00a0remain in the bucket, but it\u00a0wasn't the hand-eye coordination that Betchart was examining.\n\"We did that for a few minutes, then everyone lined up on the baseline\u00a0again, and he asked for a volunteer to shoot a free throw. I volunteered, and I made the first,\u00a0and then\u00a0missed the second. I went 'Ah, man', just in disappointment,\u00a0and he asked what I did wrong.\"\n\"A couple of people said it was that I missed the free throw, and Graham said no. It was the reaction after I had missed the free throw. That was the first time I met him, and I didn't really know what was going to happen after that.\"\nWhat\u00a0eventually\u00a0happened was, this \"average-looking white dude\" would transform Gordon's life, becoming a mentor, and one of his closest friends.\nThis\u00a0brings us back to the early hours of Saturday, after\u00a0Gordon\u00a0and\u00a0Betchart\u00a0had returned\u00a0from an exclusive Jordan event downtown.\nWhat was expected to be a routine appearance\u00a0at the red-carpet event;\u00a0turned into the pair meeting up with Michael Jordan, himself.\nThis proved to be a\u00a0somewhat\u00a0surreal moment for Betchart, who has long admired the mindset of the NBA legend.\n\"George [Mumford] also works with Lucid. So to meet Michael Jordan, with Aaron, was a culmination of everything we've been through,\" Betchart enthused. \"To have Michael look me in the eye and tell me, 'George saved me.' It was a surreal moment.\"\nGordon,\u00a0similarly, has his own tale of salvation. He was shooting free throws at around 40 percent\u00a0at the University of Arizona, but sought to overcome his limits, and master this stroke in the NBA.\n\"To learn how to shoot free throws, you had to work on mastering, which is all about failure,\" Betchart shared. \"He learned that you had to fail to the top. He just needed the positive affirmation of 'I love free throws.' Because we know it was the opposite.\"\n\"Now, 900 days later, he's shooting (around) 70 percent in the pros.\"\nIf anything is apparent, it is the fact that Gordon is a solid proponent of sports psychology.\n\"Buy in. Buy in. More than anything, you need to have a solid mentality. The mentality comes from compassion for yourself, and love for the game.\"\nThe process, and friendship,\u00a0however,\u00a0didn't happen overnight.\u00a0\n\"I'd always listen to what he had to say, and take it for what it was worth, but I didn't understand the value of it until I got to college,\" Gordon laughed. \"All throughout high school, I would always listen to Graham and I would always benefit. But it wasn't until college, that I realized how beneficial it actually was.\"\nGordon's emotional investment in Betchart, and his work, is set to reward him further, as he's expected to become the first athlete to sign with the company.\nIt's\u00a0clear that Gordon isn't in this for any kind of monetary reward. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, he's intent on making the world a better place.I want to evolve humans as a whole. I want Lucid to evolve humans as a whole.Aaron Gordon\n\"I want to evolve humans as a whole,\" Gordon said. \"I want Lucid to evolve humans as a whole.\"\n\"Lucid want to make the world a better place. I've asked Graham how I could make the world a better place.\"\n\"Obviously, it started with making myself a better person. Their goal is incredible. They've made it something tangible, trying to make the world a better place.\"\nWhen he's not hitting the hardwood as one of the NBA's most explosive athletes, Gordon makes sure to read as much as possible.\nGeorge Mumford's book, \"Mindfulness,\" is a particular favorite of\u00a0Gordon's;\u00a0along with anything that\u00a0looks at\u00a0transcendental meditation, or the intricacies of quantum physics.\nFor Gordon, it's all about education. As much as he can continue to improve his vertical jump\u00a0--\u00a0pleasing basketball fans with his aesthetically pleasing leaping ability -- that takes a back seat to his insistence to train his mind.\nAs professional sports teams slowly incorporate these practices into their respective organizations, Lucid is in the midst of creating a mobile app, so the average person can also take advantage of mental training.\n\"It's not all that apparent, right now, in professional sports,\" Gordon said.\n\"There are definitely teams that have it, and those teams are successful, and have a different mindset about themselves. I'd say, within the next five to 10 years, every team\u00a0will\u00a0have a sports psychologist like Graham.\"\nIt's not just what seems to be an intrinsic passion that Betchart espouses, but it's the air of positivity that fills any room he's in.\nHis ability to connect with people -- elite athletes, in particular -- is what will set his plan in motion.\n\"Our mission is to\u00a0bring mindfulness to the world,\" Betchart said, with a glint in his eye.\n\"I need it to make a billion dollars, because then we know it's reached a lot of people. I feel like it's my purpose to bring mental training forward, through Lucid, and to have someone like Jason, and then to bring someone like Aaron on; we all have the same purpose.\"\nAs the clock struck 3 a.m., Gordon finally\u00a0conceded that he had to get some\u00a0much-needed shut-eye.From throwing\u00a0ping-pong\u00a0balls into a bucket, to meeting\u00a0with\u00a0Michael Jordan. It's just\u00a0perfect.Aaron Gordon\nGenerally, the excitement of competing in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest would lead to a lot of nerves for a 20-year-old, and while he\u00a0admitted that\u00a0there\u00a0was\u00a0some nerves, Gordon was more excited than anything else.\nHe's embracing the moment, and is looking forward to competing against his good friend, and reigning Slam Dunk Champion, Zach\u00a0LaVine.\nThe Timberwolves' high-flyer is widely regarded as the\u00a0favorite\u00a0to win the event, but Gordon isn't writing himself off, just yet.\n\"A lot of the guys are really\u00a0really\u00a0talented, so I think I just\u00a0have to come with my best stuff,\" Gordon conceded. \"But\u00a0I wouldn't be here if I couldn't compete with Zach.\"\nWhat better way to spend the night leading up to the Slam Dunk Contest, than to meet with \"His Airness,'' Michael Jordan.\nConnecting with Jordan was the final piece of the puzzle.\u00a0It was the culmination of the perfect circularity that is\u00a0Graham\u00a0Betchart's\u00a0work with Gordon.\n\"From throwing Ping-Pong\u00a0balls into a bucket, to meeting\u00a0with\u00a0Michael Jordan,\" Gordon exhaled.\u00a0\"It's just\u00a0perfect.\""},

Magic Johnson waddles the ball up the court. On one side of the broken break, he has Shaquille O\u2019Neal lumbering as if he\u2019s recovering from one of his famous trip-and-falls on Inside the NBA. On his other side is all-time great shooter Reggie Miller trudging through the mud of the hardwood.\nMagic had Showtime. Now, he\u2019d have slowtime. The fastbreak might fall apart, but somehow, if only for the one throwback pass from Magic, if only for the nostalgia, we\u2019d all want to watch.\nThe NBA needs an old-timers' game on All-Star Weeekend.\nIt's happened before, although admittedly with mixed results. The NBA first experimented with a \"Legends Game\" in 1957, according to Wikipedia, and tried again in 1964. Then, the idea stayed dormant for a while, until 1984 \u2014 a game which still exists for the most part on YouTube:\nThe Legends Game continued into the early 1990s, when the league canceled the concept because of injury concerns and a disparity in ability between younger and older retired players.\nBut an entire generation (or two) of NBA superstars has cycled through the league since then, many of whom are now Hall of Famers. More importantly, they've remained in the public eye through various broadcasting and entertainment endeavors. We see these guys on TV all the time, and we see them talking basketball. Doesn't it make you kind of wonder if they have anything left?\nBesides, doesn\u2019t it irk you just a little when some player from the \u201890s reminisces about how much better the game was back in his day? Don\u2019t you want to know if that\u2019s actually true? And wouldn\u2019t it be cool to see him back it up ... quite literally back it up if it\u2019s a post player getting wistful about the days of behind-to-the-basket play? Conversely, don\u2019t you want to see Miller dart to the 3-point line on that break as if he\u2019s Klay Thompson? The adjusted parts of the game \u2014 especially for shooters, considering shooting is usually the final skill to erode with age \u2014 could yield endless fun moments.\nOf course, the retirees wouldn\u2019t be going all out. They\u2019re in their 40s and 50s. Maybe their 60s. But this doesn\u2019t have to be about just the players. The NBA could bring everything \u201880s and \u201890s back: The music, the culture, the short shorts, Ahmad Rashad. Heck, we can even pry former referee Dick Bavetta from the ranch he retired to and have him officiate one last game \u2014 and maybe he can  again while he\u2019s at it.\nIn the end, All-Star Weekend is supposed to be fun. In some ways, it\u2019s become routine.\nWe have the celebrity game, a made-for-TV event which seems to be lacking in big names each year and which, frankly, isn\u2019t so great on TV. We have the dunk contest and 3-point contest, which can be hit or miss. We have the All-Star Game, which is good for some alley-oops and fun highlights, but which isn\u2019t actually a basketball game.\nAn old-timers' game wouldn\u2019t be a basketball game, either. If you have a problem with the lack of defense you see on Sunday nights during All-Star Weekend, then you\u2019d certainly be up in arms while watching former All-Stars go at it years after their primes. But it\u2019s worth it for the sentimentality. It\u2019s worth it to see Barkley panting. It\u2019s worth it to watch one last potentially brilliant dime from Magic or to see if Michael Jordan still has a smidge of greatness in him. One hook shot from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or a barely-off-the-ground, bottom-of-the-rim-scraping dunk from Dominique Wilkins would send the crowd roaring \u2014 and deservedly so.\nSo, make it happen, NBA. Shake up All-Star Weekend. And when looking for something new, you might be able to find the best in something old."},

It sizzles at the apex of world-class creativity and unparalleled athleticism.\u00a0\nEach year, some of the most important memories in NBA history are created at this event \u2014 \u0080\u0094except for when they aren't.\nOn Saturday night, we have a pretty interesting field, headlined by defending champion , All-Star , hilarious person  and mystery box phenom Aaron Gordon.\nHere's how we think things will turn out ():\n\nWhy can't Andre Drummond win? It's simple: He's a big guy. And, fair or not, big guys in the dunk contest are compared with each other, not their competition. If whatever he does isn't more impressive than JaVale McGee's performance in 2011, or Dwight Howard's Superman show in 2008, then it's a dud.\nDrummond can't match McGee's elasticity, and he lacks Howard's insatiable desire for fame. He's more of a power dunker than anything else, and that typically doesn't work when nobody's around to overpower:\u00a0\nThen again, Drummond is the biggest name and best all-around player by a very wide margin, and that could work in his favor for an event that's mainly about showmanship and popularity.Hit 'em with it  \nExtra points if he takes off from the free-throw line. Pun intended.\u00a0\n\nIf you're genuinely interested in picking the upset, Will the Thrill is a really smart option. When the contestants were first announced last week, Barton immediately stood out as the most surprising participant. Despite a solid 2015-16 season that will earn him Most Improved Player consideration, most NBA fans probably don't know who Barton is.Favorite dunk of all time? Easy. Can\u2019t wait to do my thing in Toronto    \nBut NBA diehards are well aware of the ridiculous in-game destruction he's caused on numerous occasions this season:\nRockets forward Donatas Motiejunas has missed most of this season with a back injury. But the real reason he's out, according to us: Secretly, he just doesn't want something like this to ever happen again.\u00a0\n\nSerious question: Is Aaron Gordon the most athletic participant in Slam Dunk Contest history? There is no correct answer here, unless your answer is yes.\u00a0\nIf your laptop/phone/iPad spontaneously combusted trying to watch all three of those clips at the same time, our sincerest apologies. If all your electronic devices are still in one piece, let this serve as an appetizer for Saturday night's main event:\nGordon is human evolution in full effect. Bodies that large aren't meant to move the way his moves. It floats and crashes. There are no constraints on what the 20-year-old should be able to accomplish tomorrow night; the only thing holding him back is his own imagination.\u00a0\n\nWe began this piece calling the NBA Slam Dunk Contest one of the least predictable events in all of sports. Well, that's technically true. But in terms of predicting a winner, it's hard to watch everything Zach LaVine did last year and then not think he's the extreme odds-on favorite to hit a walk-off grand slam every year until he's 31.\nIn real life, much of LaVine's game is problematic. For some reason, the Timberwolves badly want him to be a point guard (which is a shame, because he's not a point guard), and his perimeter defense might be worst in the league. But as a human highlight machine, this person could be the most tantalizing deliverer of YouTube goodies since YouTube was invented.\u00a0\nOn top of that, he takes his Playstation very seriously:When your on the road and the hotel tv has no hdmi cord for the ps4! Crazy!\nFor real, if LaVine doesn't dominate this whole event, it means one of the other three dudes pulled off a top-5 all-time jam. So no matter what happens, everybody who watches walks away a winner! (Except for the unlucky few who bet three month's rent on Drummond.)"},

His answer was short and sweet (unless you're a Lakers fan):A reporter asked Russell Westbrook today if he wants to play for the Lakers \nThat might just be Westbrook having some fun with the media and a predictable line of questions. Still, it's a pretty nasty burn for the Lakers. Westbrook's from Los Angeles, and he played college ball at UCLA. The fact that he'd so quickly decline any hint of a conversation about playing for the Lakers hurts.\nAssuming Westbrook stays true to his word and remains in Oklahoma City (and despite all the rumors about his teammate Kevin Durant heading elsewhere, the likeliest outcome from where we sit is both players sticking around, at least for now), maybe we'll stop trying to put each big NBA free agent in LeBron James' shoes.\nJust because The King went home doesn't mean that's what everyone wants to do.

There was symmetry in that being in the shadow of the big league's All-Star weekend almost served as a reminder to the D-League's best that the NBA might not be as far from their reach as they sometimes think.\n ''You're always hopeful,'' said Fredette, the MVP of Saturday's D-League game in which the Eastern Conference squad beat its Western Conference counterparts 128-124. ''Everybody in this league, that's what their dream is. They want to get back or into the NBA, or further their career. That's what this league is for, and I'm no different.''\n Well, he sort of is.\n Fredette was the No. 10 pick by the  in the 2011 draft, not long after ''Jimmermania'' swept college basketball when he was the NCAA player of the year as a senior at BYU. He was traded to Sacramento on draft night, played in 179 games for the Kings before being waived and has had stints since with Chicago, New Orleans twice, and San Antonio.\n Right now, he's posting impressive numbers (22.6 points, 4.8 assists) with the Westchester Knicks in the D-League. Someone, he thinks, might notice.\n ''They want to see fight,'' Fredette said.\n More than half of the players in Saturday's D-League game have some NBA experience, the league has a record 19 teams right now - with at least three more planned in the coming years - and the stigma that accompanies going to the minors seems to be diminishing over time.\n It is becoming the true feeder league that the NBA always envisioned.\n ''I think it's all attitude and your mindset,'' said Tyus Jones of the Minnesota Timberwolves, a first-round NBA draft pick in 2015 who spent some time in the D-League. ''If you look at it as an opportunity to play and work on things in a game setting, then you're going to make the most of it. If you look at it as `Why do I have to go down there and I shouldn't have to and this isn't fair,' then you're not going to get as good of results as you can.''\n The list of success stories just keeps growing.\n The first D-League call-up was Chris Andersen in 2001, and when the  forward was told of how common it is now - there were more than 60 call-ups to the NBA last season - he raved about how far the league has come. Heat center Hassan Whiteside, who also toiled in the D-League, could be in line for a big-time contract this summer. Seth Curry, the brother of the reigning NBA MVP, played in the D-League before his NBA chance came as well.\n Milwaukee's Khris Middleton played in the D-League for exactly three games. But what he showed in those three games, he thinks, might have been part of the reason why the Bucks got him as part of a trade with Detroit. And this past summer, Middleton signed a deal that will pay him $70 million over five years.\n ''I was only there for a few games,'' Middleton said. ''But I know they helped me. I needed to play.''\n For as far as the D-League has come - and it has - there's no denying it's still a grind.\n ''This was a great opportunity for these kids,'' Eastern Conference coach Dan Craig of the Sioux Falls Skyforce said. ''It's an All-Star Game at a professional level. It's really great for them.''\n Craig and his Skyforce assistant Octavio De La Grana were in a hurry to get out after the game, for a very simple reason. They had about two hours to get to the airport and catch a flight to ensure they would be back with the Skyforce on Sunday, because practice awaits.\n Such is life in the D-League.\n It's not easy, but there a colossal potential payoff.\n ''It's an opportunity to develop my game,'' Fredette said. ''That's what this league is for.''\n ---\n AP Basketball Writer Jon Krawczynski contributed to this report."},

When he addressed the media before Saturday's All-Star festivities in Toronto, however, Silver clarified that the adjustment would not be immediate.\n\"A change will not be enacted this season,\" Silver announced. \"But it's an issue that we've been studying for some time now.\"\nSilver added he didn't think it would be fair to change the rule in the middle of the season.\nIntentional fouling has become a prevalent problem this season. If those who believed the rules that allow for Hack-a-Shaq or Deck-a-DJ or Ram-a-Rondo shouldn't be changed because they affect only three or four players around the league, then they may be changing their minds after what's gone on this year.\nNow it's happening routinely in Los Angeles with DeAndre Jordan, in Detroit with Andre Drummond and in Houston with Dwight Howard and Clint Capela. We've seen teams hack Rajon Rondo and Hassan Whiteside. And Silver confirmed Saturday that our eyes aren't lying to us when they tell us hacking is up around the NBA.\n\"So far, up to the All-Star break this season, we're seeing the Hack-a-Shaq strategy used at roughly a five-and-a-half times greater rate than it was used last season,\" Silver said Saturday. \"It's showing there is a clear trend, and that clearly our coaches, who are smart and using very complex analytics, believe it is benefiting them.\"\nEven though a rule change may not be imminent this season, it doesn't mean it isn't coming at all.\n\"My personal view, as I said last week, is beginning to change on the issue,\" Silver said. \"I'm beginning to feel that a change needs to be made, and that comes in response to conversations with our network partners. It comes in response to fan data that we look at.\"\nThe arguments against hack-a mainly stem from preserving the entertainment value of the game. Fans and general basketball watchers mostly don't want to see bad free-throw shooters shooting free throws over and over again as reserves enter games to foul them.\nA change in the intentional fouling regulations would require two-thirds of the owners to vote in favor of a new rule to eliminate the incentive to hack.\n\"So we're nowhere near that point where we're even starting to count heads,\" Silver said. \"And I think there is a reason when the constitution and bylaws were written of the NBA that those founders decided that it should take two-thirds of teams to change a rule. I think it should be a very deliberate process, you know, and nothing should be done harshly, which is why I'm not in favor of changing the rule midseason.\"\nSo he believes owners will consider it at their April meeting with the hope of having something to vote on during their July meeting.\n"},

And while the All-Star game traditionally isn't known for defense, Pop knows what Kobe wants: a challenge. So Pop stepped up his game at Saturday's All-Star practice and (jokingly) tried to shut down the Black Mamba:\nThat's pretty good lateral movement from the 67-year-old Popovich, who will coach Bryant and the rest of the Western Conference All-Stars on Sunday. Maybe the Spurs coach could let Tim Duncan in on his secrets for staying so spry and young after all these years in the league."},

Wiggins received the loudest ovation when the players were announced before the game, and he threw down a couple of big dunks in the first few minutes to get the game going.\n Denver Nuggets point guard Emmanuel Mudiay threw the ball off the backboard to a soaring Wiggins that got the crowd on its feet.\n The World team also has Canadians Trey Lyles and Dwight Powell.\n - Jon Krawczynski\n ---\n 9:05 p.m.\n Drake outcoached Kevin Hart, and didn't even need to put on a uniform for his win.\n Canada's first chance to host the NBA's midseason showcase got off to a flying start Friday night, with the Grammy winner leading his nation's team to a 74-63 win over the United States in the All-Star celebrity game.\n With All-Stars like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kyle Lowry looking on, as well as celebs like Spike Lee, Vin Diesel and Guy Fieri in the stands, Drake - aided by a dunk from tennis star Milos Raonic - led the Canadians to a nine-point lead at the half.\n That led Hart - a celebrity game veteran - to turn over the U.S. coaching duties to All-Star Andre Drummond in the third quarter, change into a uniform and insert himself into the game.\n To say players took the game less than seriously would be accurate. Rick Fox was taking selfies on Canada's bench, Hart feigned crying when a montage of his best celebrity game moments played to the tune of ''One Shining Moment,'' and Canadian tennis player Genie Bouchard talked trash somewhat comically.\n Canada's Win Butler got MVP honors, after a 15-point, 14-rebound performance. And then he promptly retired from celebrity games, or so he said.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 8:45 p.m.\n Drake is going to be busy throughout All-Star weekend.\n Not only is he coaching Canada's team in Friday's celebrity game, he'll also be involved with the All-Star player introductions on Sunday night. The NBA says that the Grammy winner and Toronto Raptors Global Ambassador ''will be adding his own special touch'' to the proceedings.\n Drake is a Toronto native, and got a ''key to the city'' earlier Friday.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 8:15 p.m.\n Milos Raonic put an exclamation point on Canada's dominant first half against the U.S. in the All-Star celebrity game Friday night.\n The 6-foot-5 tennis star, the 11th-ranked player in the world who lost in the semifinals of the Australian Open, was able throw down a two-handed dunk, giving coach Drake and Canada a 37-28 halftime lead against Kevin Hart and the United States team.\n The celebrities on the floor showed flashes of solid basketball skills, including actor Jason Sudeikis, who had three 3-pointers and scored 11 points in the first half for the U.S.\n There also were celebrities taking in the action at courtside, including Spike Lee, Vin Diesel, and All-Star guards Kyle Lowry and Klay Thompson.\n ---\n 6:05 p.m.\n Chris Bosh is out of the All-Star Game and the 3-point contest, though is staying in Toronto for the remainder of the weekend.\n Bosh said he has a strained right calf, which he didn't reveal during media sessions earlier Friday. The team made the announcement late Friday afternoon, and Bosh says he needs extra time ''to try to heal and focus on the second half'' of the season.\n Al Horford will replace Bosh on the All-Star roster, and Portland's C.J. McCollum will take his spot in the 3-point contest.\n The  will already be without one of their big men when their schedule resumes. Hassan Whiteside won't play in Atlanta next Friday, suspended one game by the NBA for throwing an elbow during 's loss to San Antonio earlier this week. And with fellow Heat big man Chris Andersen still out with a bad knee, the prospects of not having Bosh for Miami's next real game likely weighed into the decision.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 4:15 p.m.\n NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said more than once that advertisements on jerseys is an inevitable development. Reigning MVP Steph Curry said on Friday at his All-Star press conference that ''nothing is going to stop that train from coming.''\n ''I don't want it to be too gimmicky where we're walking ads for just everything,'' Curry said. ''I'm trying to keep the classic look of a basketball uniform that we all know and love.\n ''I've seen soccer uniforms where they marks all over the jerseys. Whether you like it or not, that's kind of been that way for a while. The transition will be a little weird for sure.''\n - Jon Krawczynski\n ---\n 3:55 p.m.\n LeBron James is amused over all the fuss that accompanied Tyronn Lue getting the chance to coach the Eastern Conference in Sunday's All-Star Game.\n The honor typically goes to the coaching staff of the team leading their respective conference at the break, provided that staff didn't also coach in the game the year before. So when the  fired David Blatt and promoted Lue from his assistant spot to being the coach in charge, that meant Lue also got the All-Star duty.\n And while it might seem strange to some, James was quick to point out Friday at the All-Star media day that Lue ''would have been here anyways, even if coach Blatt was still our coach.''\n James has been criticized for what many presume to be his role in Blatt's dismissal, and the four-time MVP says he isn't letting that perception bother him. He also didn't take the bait when asked to describe differences between Blatt and Lue.\n James' answer: ''Their height.''\n For the record, Blatt (6-foot-3) is listed to be about three inches taller than Lue.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 2:15 p.m.\n Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson are finalists for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n College coaches Tom Izzo, Eddie Sutton, Lefty Driesell, Bo Ryan and Muffet McGraw, and women's star Sheryl Swoopes were also among the finalists announced Friday.\n They could be voted as Hall of Famers when the full class is announced in April.\n So could Yao Ming, who is already a finalist and could be directly elected from the International Committee.\n - Brian Mahoney\n ---\n 1:58 p.m.\n New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony says he hopes the owners and the players union can come to a new labor agreement without a work stoppage.\n Anthony was speaking on Friday as part of the kickoff to All-Star weekend festivities. Either side can choose to opt out of the current collective bargaining agreement until Dec. 15.\n Last time the two sides could not come to an agreement, the owners locked out the players that shortened the 2011-12 season by 16 games.\n ''I hope we can come to an agreement sooner rather than later,'' said Anthony, who fully endorse NBPA executive director Michele Roberts. ''We don't want another lockout. We just have to sit down at the table. Now, it's talking about more important issues than we talked about in the past and being transparent with each other.''\n - Jon Krawczynski\n ---\n 1:25 p.m.\n Kobe Bryant has gone through an All-Star media day for the final time.\n The retiring star of the Los Angeles Lakers took questions for about 30 minutes, laughed and smiled throughout, accepted some gifts from international reporters - including a photo that said ''thank you'' - and spoke in English, Italian and a little Spanish at times. He even asked a reporter from Taiwan to teach him a phrase in his language.\n Topics ranged from his love of storytelling (which he intends to make his next passion after basketball), what he would tell his 8-year-old self (enjoy the moment) and how long he wants to play in the All-Star Game on Sunday night.\n Bryant says he would be fine playing just 10 minutes. Fans, however, are probably hoping for far more than that.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 11:45 a.m.\n Chris Paul looked at a teammate, then glared at an opponent. Dwyane Wade made what he thought was a great play, then yelled in disbelief when it didn't work out to his liking.\n The games have started at All-Star weekend - and no, not of the basketball variety.\n Wade and the sock company Stance hosted a Spades tournament on Thursday night and the card game was attended by plenty of current and former players, including Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson.\n It was the second annual tournament, and much like last year's debut in New York, the players took the game very - very - seriously.\n Before he sat down to play with his teammate (and wife) Gabrielle Union, Wade says players don't turn off the competitive fires that fuel them on the court, explaining that ''competitive people like winning, no matter what we do.''\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 10:20 a.m.\n NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has opened All-Star weekend by paying homage to the league's history in Toronto.\n Silver spoke Friday morning at the NBA All-Star Technology Summit, and began his remarks by reminding attendees that the league's enormous success globally stems in part from what happened in Toronto on Nov. 1, 1946 - when the first game in what was then called the Basketball Association of America was played.\n Silver is calling this weekend ''a very special one for us in the NBA, a homecoming.''\n It was in Toronto on that night nearly 70 years ago when the New York Knicks visited and beat the Toronto Huskies 68-66. The game was played at Maple Leaf Gardens - ''which, if you're curious, is now a grocery store,'' Silver says\n - Tim Reynolds"},

{"url": "http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/west-all-stars-east-all-stars-preview-021316", "text": "\n TORONTO (AP) Kobe Bryant answered questions in Spanish and Italian, raved about Canadian hospitality, showed off knowledge of both Greek basketball and English soccer. He announced plans to go to the Philippines and Taiwan, thanked fans from Japan and even asked a reporter how to say a phrase in Mandarin.\n It all made perfect sense.\n The basketball world belongs to Bryant, at least for one more weekend.\n About 750 million people around the globe are expected to follow Sunday's NBA All-Star Game in one form or another, and it's a safe guess most will do so to keep a keen eye on Bryant's final appearance in the league's midseason showcase. His farewell season now officially starting to wind down, the ' star was the center of attraction at media day Friday - and seemed most appreciative.\n ''I just feel very blessed to be able to play so many years, man,'' Bryant said. ''Twenty years is a long time, so I feel very good about it.''\n Bryant was the leading vote-getter in the fan balloting that chose the starting lineup for Sunday's game, a lifetime achievement award more than anything related to his play this season. At 37 years old, he's obviously not the same player he was when he was helping the Lakers win five championships, though during the season he's shown flashes of what made him one of the game's all-time elite.\n Bryant said he'd be fine playing 10 minutes Sunday.\n Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant isn't buying that one.\n ''We definitely want to send him off on a good note,'' Durant said. ''We know he's going to be super competitive.''\n It is a festive sendoff, for certain.\n Dozens of media members staked out space around Bryant's podium long before he started speaking Friday, though some just wanted to take selfies with him in the background. Bryant was a featured panelist at the NBA's technology summit earlier in the morning to share ideas with league executives and others, and has his wife and their two daughters in Toronto so the whole family can bask in the celebrations.\n ''This is pretty cool,'' Bryant said. ''I'm looking around the room and I'm seeing guys that I'm playing with that are tearing the league up that were like 4 for my first All-Star Game. ... How many players can say they played 20 years and actually have seen the game go through three, four generations? It's not sad at all. I'm really happy and honored to be here and see this.''\n So were his All-Star peers.\n Cleveland's LeBron James still might be the best player in the world, Miami's Dwyane Wade has more championship rings than any other All-Star this year besides Bryant, Toronto's Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan are getting the hometown support and Golden State's Stephen Curry is the reigning MVP for a team that won last year's title.\n But they all know the spotlight is going to be on No. 24.\n ''I think it's going to be special,'' said James, who got Bryant's sneakers autographed after the Lakers visited Cleveland earlier this week for his own trophy case. ''Not only for myself, but for the fans here and for all of Kobe's fans.''\n And Bryant's career-best 81-point game against the Raptors might be a sore subject in Toronto, but it still stands out to Curry as the quintessential Kobe moment.\n ''I've been hot before and made every shot I threw up there and got on a little streak in a game,'' said Curry, the game's premier sharpshooter. ''But to score 81 points, so many things have to go right and the situation has to be just perfect for it and you have to have a special talent level like Kobe to do it.\n ''Just watching the game, it still doesn't make sense. How did he do it?''\n Bryant made the decision early this season that he would retire, then announced it weeks ago not because he wanted a farewell tour - he originally wasn't keen on that idea, though has been moved by the tributes that have come as he's visited NBA cities as an opponent for the last time - but because he wanted to start the process of moving on for both himself and the Lakers.\n As far as All-Star selections, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has more than Bryant's 18.\n ''I know it will kind of be bittersweet for a lot of people, but it should be celebrated like it will be,'' said Miami's Chris Bosh, who was slated to play in the All-Star Game but withdrew Friday afternoon with a calf injury. ''He's the legal voting age in All-Star years. That's crazy. His body of work is second to none. I think it's good for him to have some sort of closure and he can move on.''"},

Bosh says he's excited to see Toronto host the All-Star Game - he spent his first seven NBA seasons in the city - and Butler revealed that he's a big Taylor Swift fan.\n Suffice to say, it isn't the most competitive practice.\n Celebrity chef Guy Fieri is watching from a courtside seat, raving about the quality and variety of culinary options in Toronto. And the Raptors' All-Star duo of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan addressed the crowd before the practice began.\n Last-minute All-Star replacement  also talked to the crowd, saying he's looking forward to having ''fun with the best players in the league.''\n Up next: The Western Conference practice.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 11:05 a.m.\n Better late than never: Atlanta's Al Horford has arrived at All-Star weekend.\n Horford was selected Friday as the replacement for Miami Heat forward Chris Bosh, who pulled out with a strained right calf. Horford was vacationing in the Caribbean when the NBA called, packed up quickly and arrived in Toronto late Friday night.\n Here's hoping he had sweaters with him: Temperatures in Toronto are likely to stay below zero all day Saturday, though as NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, ''I'm told the game will be played indoors.''\n Horford will practice with the East squad and take part in team meetings Saturday, then come off the bench in Sunday night's All-Star contest.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n 10:30 a.m.\n Kobe Bryant has gotten one impressive retirement gift from Michael Jordan.\n The Jordan Brand gave Bryant a full set of the sneakers released so far in the Air Jordan line - 30 pairs in all. The gift was presented early Saturday at the Jordan Brand All-Star party, which Bryant attended.\n Jordan Brand President Larry Miller says the gift was presented ''to honor one of the game's great players and the legacy that he created.''\n Bryant is an 18-time All-Star who is retiring from the Los Angeles Lakers when this season ends. He got the Jordan set in white; the company made an alternate full black set in Bryant's size 14, and they're being auctioned off on eBay for charity. The auction starts Saturday at noon Eastern, ending Sunday at the same time.\n - Tim Reynolds\n ---\n A year after Stephen Curry had a record 27 points in the final round of the 3-point contest to beat  teammate Klay Thompson, the latter is coming in with confidence on All-Star Saturday.\n Thompson knows how good Curry is, so he couldn't have been terribly surprised when he was told during NBA All-Star player interviews that ''everyone'' thinks Curry is going to win the 3-point contest Saturday night.\n It's not bothering Thompson, though. He says he's happy to ''play the underdog for a night.''\n The 3-point contest takes place between the Skills Challenge and slam dunk contest, but it may be the main event with the Splash Brothers from the NBA champions leading the field.\n - Brian Mahoney"},
