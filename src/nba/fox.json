Though Bryant probably wouldn't be too unhappy walking away another All-Star Game MVP trophy.\n The final NBA showcase for Bryant and the first to be staged outside the U.S. is in Toronto, the city that staged the first NBA game 70 years ago and is so enthusiastic for basketball now that it could no longer be ignored no matter what the thermometer says.\n ''I think it's going to be bonkers,'' former Raptors superstar Vince Carter said.\n ''I think it's overdue. It's a great city. I think they'll be a great host and I think guys are going to have a lot of fun. It's going to be cold.''\n Frigid, actually.\n A relatively mild winter by Canada's standards will be nothing but a warm memory this weekend, when Saturday's forecast is for temperatures near zero degrees and far below it with the wind chill. The players can cover up with the parkas Canada Goose, maker of cold weather outerwear, designed for them.\n The NBA long sought warm-weather locations for its winter road trip, and cities that had a good chance for a white Christmas generally had little hope of getting All-Star weekend.\n But Toronto, where the Toronto Huskies and New York Knicks played on Nov. 1, 1946, in Maple Leaf Gardens and is so passionate about its Raptors that general manager Masai Ujiri was fined a couple years ago for using an expletive about playoff opponent Brooklyn - with Commissioner Adam Silver in attendance - is ''an ideal host,'' Silver said.\n ''There is a special energy and excitement around All-Star this year, and we're looking forward to four days of great events that honor our marquee players and legends, celebrate the game, and provide loads of excitement for our fans,'' Silver said.\n If Bryant heats up, he could add a fifth All-Star Game MVP award to his collection.\n The events kick off Friday, the slam dunk and 3-point contests are Saturday and the game is Sunday night.\n ---\n Some things to watch this weekend:\n BRYANT'S BEST? Bryant is a four-time MVP of the All-Star Game and its career scoring leader - though now just two points ahead of LeBron James. Does the 18-time All-Star's aching body have enough left at 37 for one more vintage performance? ''Knowing Kobe as well as I do, I'm sure if he gets going, and the guys get him going, you know the crowd's going to want it to happen; certain players are going to want it to happen,'' former teammate Shaquille O'Neal said in remarks provided by TNT. ''If he can find his stroke and get it going a little bit, I can guarantee you he's going to go for the MVP. It's his last one? Why not go out with a bang?''\n THEY'VE GOT SKILLS: The NBA announced the bracket Thursday for Saturday's Skills Challenge, the event that combines dribbling, passing and shooting and this year features a number of big men in a field that traditionally is for guards. A big guy is guaranteed to reach the final. All-Stars Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins meet in the first round, with the winner to face All-Star Draymond Green or rookie Karl-Anthony Towns in the semifinals. The little guys are on the other side: Denver's Emmanuel Mudiay vs. All-Star Isaiah Thomas, and the Lakers' Jordan Clarkson against Portland's CJ McCollum.\n GOOD GAME? The early part of the All-Star Game is always about showing off sneakers and dunks, but count on it becoming competitive down the stretch. The last six games have been determined by an average of 4.7 points. ''We've been actually fortunate in recent years. Despite the highlight-type schoolyard play early on we've had some good games down the stretch and obviously that's what we hope for,'' said Marv Albert, who will call the game on TNT.\n NO VINSANITY: Carter, now playing for Memphis, is the Raptors' career leader with 23.4 points per game and a former slam dunk champion. But he won't be in the city he called the NBA's ''best-kept secret,'' instead spending his break watching his daughter play in a tennis tournament. ''It's just bad timing because I know it's going to be epic and I would love to be there,'' he said. ''It's just daddy duties first.''"},

He set his ego aside. He knew that 55-touchdown pass seasons were in his past, so he dinked and dunked the  through the playoffs and to the Super Bowl. He didn\u2019t try to do what he was no longer physically able to do. What had been a career defined by monstrous regular-season stats and failings in the playoffs turned into a season defined by ugly regular-season stats and doing just enough to let his teammates burst through the playoffs and win it all. The former superstar got as close as an NFL quarterback can get to becoming a role player, and in so doing he wrote a fitting final chapter to his Hall of Fame career.\nAnd Kobe?\nWell. Kobe is Kobe. Kobe is an all-time great. Kobe won five rings for the Los Angeles Lakers by working harder than anyone else, by demanding the ball, by knowing that he was the best player on the floor and by willing his teams to victory. Kobe was the NBA\u2019s biggest Alpha Male since Michael Jordan and the most successful player since Jordan as well.\nBut when Kobe\u2019s powers left him in his late 30s, he could not adjust. He could not cede to teammates and become a bit player. He could not put the franchise he\u2019d brought so much past glory before the glory he still needed for himself.\nIt\u2019s something that was entirely predictable from Kobe Bean Bryant: When it was time to step aside and be a role player \u2013 when it was time for him to do what Peyton did for the Broncos \u2013 he could not.\nUnlike Peyton, who demurred at several opportunities to announce his retirement in the lead-up to and immediate aftermath of the Super Bowl, Kobe made his final season all about himself. He is in the midst of a much-deserved but terribly narcissistic farewell tour. He held his franchise hostage in the final years of his career \u2013 not just because of his league-high $25 million salary that gave the Lakers little roster flexibility but because of his insistence that the Lakers were still all about Kobe. In truth, Kobe was all about hurting the franchise he had become synonymous with.\nLook at his final Lakers team. It is an embarrassing 11-44, last in the Western Conference, second-worst record in the league next to the Sixers.\nWorse still, Kobe\u2019s ego has set the Lakers back a couple years in what should have been a swift rebuild. His need to still play a starring role has sullied an entire season of development for young and promising players like D\u2019Angelo Russell and Julius Randle. He\u2019s hogging the minutes and the attention. He\u2019s teaching the kids bad, ball-dominating habits that could prove difficult to unteach.\nI don\u2019t need to give you too many statistics to grasp the totality of Kobe\u2019s struggles this season, but I will anyway. His player efficiency rating ranks 163 in the league, sandwiched between that of Shabazz Muhammad and Tiago Splitter. Not counting his injury-shortened 2013-14 season, he is averaging fewer points per game than he has in any season since 1997-98, when he still came off the bench in his second year as a pro. Kobe ranks 145 in VORP (value over replacement player), right between Brandon Bass and Michael Carter-Williams. The Lakers rank last in the league in effective field-goal percentage, and much of the blame for that falls to Kobe.\nThis is not Michael Jordan going to the Washington Wizards. This isn\u2019t Joe Montana going to the Kansas City Chiefs. This is different because Kobe is holding back the same franchise that he brought so much glory.\nIt\u2019s not all Kobe who is to blame. Who wouldn\u2019t take all the money he could get? Who wouldn\u2019t soak in the adulation on his way out? Head coach Byron Scott deserves some blame for ceding total control to the team\u2019s ex-superstar\u2019s ego instead of to future stars. General manager Mitch Kupchak deserves some blame for allowing this dynamic to consume the franchise for two full seasons.\nA Kobe Bryant Farewell Tour would have been unassailable if it looked more like the Kevin Garnett Farewell Tour: featuring more of a player-coach than the superstar, someone who can set an example for the youngsters and set his own ego aside.\nA Kobe Bryant Farewell Tour would have been great if it had looked like the Peyton Manning Farewell Tour: not an abysmal curtain call for a fading great but a reinvention of an all-time talent.\nBut Kobe is not one to fade into the background. It is not in his DNA. The mindset that made him a once-in-a-generation player in his prime is also the mindset that makes him incapable of finding a new and lesser role now that he no longer can deliver the goods.\nKobe recently joked about how much he hates that the Lakers \u201csuck\u201d during his final season.\nWhat Kobe should hate much more is exactly how much of that is his fault.\n"},

There was no star treatment for hoop stars and no real understanding of the game. Local and national publications had to run basic tutorials that explained the rules of the basketball to fans.\n ''I don't want to say it was humbling, but to a certain degree it was. To go there where it was kind of a Basketball 101 for so many people,'' said Anthony, now an analyst for NBATV. ''We all want to feel like what we do matters. It took a while for it to really matter for the vast majority of people in Vancouver.''\n Basketball has finally carved out a much higher profile in the country's sports consciousness, albeit 20 years after Anthony first set foot in Canada as part of the NBA's initial in-roads into the country.\n The Grizzlies lasted only six seasons in Vancouver, but as the NBA's All-Star weekend kicks off on Friday night in Toronto, it offers Canadian basketball its first opportunity to really show the rest of the world how far the game has come.\n Canada is ready for its closeup.\n ''You could put it up there with some of the biggest moments in Canadian basketball history,'' said Dan McKenzie, vice president and general manager for NBA Canada.\n That list isn't incredibly long. The , the other team to break into the league with the Grizzlies in `95, have lived a largely unremarkable NBA life with only one playoff series victory in franchise history.\n Like the Grizzlies, the Raptors early days were difficult, with players and coaches often expressing reluctance about coming and staying north of the border.\n My, how times have changed.\n On the 125th anniversary of the invention of the game, the NBA is holding its midseason gala outside of the United States for the first time.\n It comes during a period of rebirth for the Raptors, who have galvanized under the leadership of general manager Masai Ujiri and coach Dwane Casey. All-Stars in Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan have led the team to the second-best record in the Eastern Conference at the break, giving their dedicated and vocal fan base reason to pack the Air Canada Center.\n There are 12 Canadian-born players in the NBA, more than any other country outside the United States. And budding young stars Andrew Wiggins and Tristan Thompson have helped put Canada's national team on the map in international competition.\n Television viewership of NBA games has doubled over the last three years, bolstered by an influx of immigrants from basketball-hungry nations like China and the Philippines.\n ''I can't express to you how far Canada Basketball has come,'' said Raptors guard Cory Joseph, a native of Toronto. ''It's going to be a crazy atmosphere. I feel like it's going to inspire the youth around town, inspire the whole country and hopefully it just skyrockets from here even more.''\n Canada is home to Dr. James Naismith, who invented the game, former two-time MVP Steve Nash and even, for a couple of years in his youth, reigning MVP Stephen Curry, who has emerged as the new face of the league. Curry's wife Ayesha is Canadian as well.\n ''I'm very familiar with the entire scene there,'' said the Golden State Warriors guard. ''I know where my house, where we used to live, Lakeshore Avenue. We drive by it from the airport to the hotel we're staying at. ... My wife's extended family all live there, she's from there, so a lot of sentimental value to going back.''\n Even Charles Barkley - noted lampooner of NBA cities like San Antonio and Oklahoma City - likes Toronto.\n ''I think it's one of the best-kept secrets in the world,'' said Barkley, the Hall of Famer and TNT analyst. ''I think it's one of the best cities in the world. They're amazing fans. You saw this year in the playoffs. You saw how crazy that place was. I think it's going to be great to shine a light on that city.''\n When he contemplates the moment that is about to arrive, Tas Melas - a longtime Raptors fan who now is co-host of ''The Starters'' on NBATV - said it sends shivers down his spine to think about where things were in the team's formative years. That's when the NBA was buried in the sports pages and deep into the nightly highlight shows in Canada.\n ''It's something no one saw coming 20 years ago when this all started,'' Melas said. ''It was just a lot of dark times. ... The reputation of the city was really lousy and it was a bit of a joke in the NBA world. This is just a huge mark of validation.''\n Most believe Vince Carter's high-flying act saved the Raptors from possible relocation at the turn of the century and got a whole generation of youngsters to pick up a basketball for the first time.\n Wiggins, the NBA's rookie of the year last year who is having another strong season for the Minnesota Timberwolves, was one of those youngsters. He will participate in the Rising Stars Challenge on Friday night, part of weekend of activities that could inspire the next generation of Canadians.\n ''People (in Canada) have never got a chance to experience something like that before, especially the younger generation,'' Wiggins said. ''Unless you're there to witness it, you don't really know how it is. It's one thing to watch it on TV and another thing watching it live in person.''\n ---\n AP Sports Writer Janie McCauley, in Oakland, contributed to this story."},

The Lakers tried to diffuse the situation, with Kobe going as far as posting a photo of him and Howard play fighting with then-coach Mike D'Antoni trying to break it up.\nBut Kobe's true feelings about Howard eventually came out. The Mamba reportedly told Howard he  when the Lakers were trying to re-sign Howard in 2013. Howard bolted to the Rockets shortly thereafter, and many thought Kobe's remarks were harsh.\nFast forward to Thursday,  that the  are reportedly dangling Howard in trade discussions. If Howard is dealt, it would be the fourth team he's played for in his 12-year career.\nThe Rockets have imploded this season. They fired Kevin McHale after a 4-7 start, and after Houston's loss Wednesday, interim head coach J.B. Bickerstaff said, \"we're broken. It's that simple.\" Veteran guard Jason Terry reportedly was much harsher:\nNow does this all fall at Howard's feet? Maybe not all of it, but he deserves some blame, along with All-Star guard James Harden. The duo was supposed to form a one-two punch that would make the Rockets a legitimate contender.\nBut the Rockets are sitting at 27-28. It would be laughable to mention them among the title contenders at this point. But Howard just wants to stay positive:\nKobe, on the other hand, thrives on a killer instinct that he didn't see in Howard (Bryant went so far as to\u00a0\u00a0when the two were tussling for a rebound in 2014). Bryant knew Howard wouldn't retaliate. He had no respect for Howard as a leader, even though Howard helped the Magic make it to the Finals in 2009.\nBryant didn't want to hand the keys to the Lakers to Howard. Los Angeles' current position (11-44) aside, the Lakers avoided a huge mistake by re-signing Howard. And the franchise \u2014 and its fans \u2014\u0080\u0093 have Kobe to thank."},

Expectation rose in the offseason when Middleton signed a five-year contract worth $70 million.\nAgainst Washington, Middleton was 1 of 3 from 3-point range, but 9 of 17 overall. Middleton also tied a season high with nine assists.\n\"Sometimes, you want to put guys in position (for more responsibility), you want to see if they grab it -- and he's grabbing it,\" coach Jason Kidd said.\nBradley Beal scored 19 points for the Wizards, and John Wall had 15 points and 10 assists.\nWashington got within three when Wall made two free throws with 1:36 left.\nBut Middleton answered again, hitting a jumper in the lane on the next possession before setting up a drive-and-dish to Greg Monroe that gave the Bucks a 97-90 lead with 15 seconds left.\n\"He was being aggressive,\" Wall said. \"When a guy gets in a rhythm, it's kind of hard to stop.

Jabari Parker scored 12 points during that quarter, when the Bucks made their run using primarily a three-guard lineup that attacked with the ball.\n\"I was just sitting here trying to contemplate on what actually happened, like how did we lose the game?\" Beal said. \"I feel like we came out aggressively, came out and played the right way in the first and third quarters, and I guess the second and fourth they made bigger plays than we did.\"\n\nA 58-38 rebounding advantage for the Bucks hurt the Wizards, as did Washington's 6-of-32 night from the 3-point line.\n\"We didn't attack,\" coach Randy Wittman said. \"Bradley did the last couple of minutes and he got to the rim. We didn't do enough of that in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nParker finished with 17 points and shot 7 of 11 from the field, playing a season-high 41 minutes.

Because of that, there has been trade speculation surrounding him all season. And now, as the  sit with a disappointing 27-28 record on the outside of the Western Conference playoff picture, Adrian Wojnarowki of Yahoo! Sports reports that .\nHe may have lost some popularity over the years, and he may not be quite as dominant or healthy as he once was in Orlando, but Howard still belongs on the list of the NBA's five best centers. He still defends. He protects the paint about as well as anyone. He grabs rebounds at an elite rate. He's capable finishing around the rim. There are teams for whom he's worth the rental -- and for whom he's worth trying to keep around after that.\nRockets general manager Daryl Morey is one of the league's more creative GMs, but he may not be able to think of every possible trade involving his current starting center. Here are a few that may get him working:\n\nHoward actually grew up in Atlanta, so even though he would play only 20-something games for the Hawks after the deal, you'd have to imagine coach Mike Budenholzer's team would have a legitimate shot to re-sign him come free agency this summer.  reported recently that the Hawks may be entertaining deals for Al Horford, who will also be a free agent at the end of this season. The current Hawks center could be a nice fit inside the Houston offense with his shooting, and you'd have to imagine the Rockets would do everything they could both to bring him back to Houston and progress his game out to the three-point line. Tiago Splitter adds some depth to the Rockets roster and Donatas Motiejunas gives the Hawks an extra young piece who could both back up and play next to Paul Millsap.\n\nMaybe the Knicks want to get out of Carmelo Anthony's contract, which still has three years left on it after this one. Maybe Melo wants to head to Houston to play next to James Harden and for a team that's only one year removed from the Western Conference finals. Maybe Howard would entertain sticking around in New York, a big market where he could still be a star. And maybe the Knicks, who have a locker room full of high-character players, would be willing to take a risk on Ty Lawson, who was one of the NBA's 10 best point guards less than a year ago. It's unlikely a trade of this magnitude would happen (especially since Anthony has a no-trade clause), but Howard and Kristaps Porzingis could make for an intimidating defensive frontcourt and a fitting offensive one. And Houston would actually get another star to play next to Harden while receiving back a quality defensive and pick-and-roll center in Robin Lopez. There are ways this deal makes sense for everyone.\n\nSo, this deal just involves everyone. The Rockets get to clear some cap space with David Lee's contract, and they receive two young pieces in Kelly Olynyk and Julius Randle. The Lakers get Hassan Whiteside, whom they can re-sign in the offseason and whom has the personality and flashiness to become a star in Los Angeles. The Heat may have a tough time trying to re-sign Whiteside this offseason, and Erik Spoelstra has sat him for plenty of fourth quarters, so Jae Crowder should be more than enough value back for him. Miami could play small lineups that included Crowder and Luol Deng at the two forward spots and Chris Bosh at the 5. The Celtics, meanwhile, get a star and a rim-protector, something Brad Stevens has never had during his time in Boston, which is why a huge deal to bring Howard to Beantown shouldn't be the only option on the table for Celtics general manager Danny Ainge ...\n\nThe Celtics owe their top-five defense to their surplus of wing defenders: Marcus Smart, Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder are all wonderful and versatile. But giving up one of those guys for a much-needed rim protector could help Boston a whole bunch. The Dallas pick, which the Celtics received in last year's deal that sent Rajon Rondo to the Mavs, would almost certainly come this year, given that it's top-seven protected. So, Houston gets a perimeter defender to complement Trevor Ariza or James Harden and a pick out of the whole thing. It could do worse while giving up a potential expiring contract.\n\nAgents are behind more transactions in the NBA than many people realize. And here, we'd actually have two clients of Dan Fegan, Dwight Howard and Chandler Parsons, traded for each other. Howard and Parsons will likely become free agents this summer (Parsons has a player option for next year, as well), and considering the  the last time Parsons was a free agent with Houston, we could be in for Fun Free Agency, Part 2. On top of that, Houston receives Zaza Pachulia, who's on a cheap contract and is in the midst of the best year of his career, and Justin Anderson, a first-round pick still in his rookie season. Everyone wins."},

There's one in Memphis, too. Maybe even in Dallas. While the top four spots in the Western Conference are practically chiseled in stone, the bottom half is primed for a major shakeup with the potential for familiar names to make surprising exits.\nWith the All-Star break upon us, the , West finals participants a season ago, are under .500, out of the playoff mix and fraying from within. It's unclear whether Houston general manager Daryl Morey is taking or placing more calls about Dwight Howard's availability.\nJust as the Memphis Grizzlies were starting to play better basketball, center Marc Gasol could be lost for the season with a broken foot, and now the Griz, eyeing another playoff battle with nemesis Los Angeles Clippers, could be goners.\u00a0\nAnd in Dallas, where the Mavericks have been praised all season for their post-DeAndre Jordan resiliency, suffered a crushing overtime loss at home to the Utah Jazz on Tuesday to fall to just three games over .500. So much talk has centered on nabbing the five-spot, but Dallas sits equally close to fifth place as it does ninth place.\nThe surprise challengers in this playoff puzzle are those Jazz, who dropped a tough one at New Orleans on Wednesday to snap a seven-game winning streak, their longest since 2010, and the resurgent Portland Trail Blazers, who are 12-3 in their last 15 games, behind All-Star snub Damian Lillard.\nLillard and the Blazers dropkicked Houston on Wednesday to set off interal Rockets fireworks and now occupy the seventh spot, with Utah in eighth.\nDallas, whose only playoff absence since 2000 came the season of Dirk Nowitzki's knee surgery, has a favorable schedule after the All-Star break. But it remains to be seen whether the Mavs can put together a consistent stretch. They haven't won two in a row since early January and are 10-13 since Jan. 1.\nIt is possible that among Houston, Dallas and Memphis, one or more will not make the playoffs. The Rockets at the moment are easily the most dysfunctional. The Grizzlies, who rely so heavily on their frontcourt, might just be undermanned, while Dallas has yet to show it can beat top teams.\nThere's also a wild card in all this: Those internally inept . Even after this bizarre stretch in which they've lost eight of 10 and were set to fire coach George Karl only not to, the 10th-place Kings are just 4 1/2 games behind the Jazz for the final playoff spot.\nWith the unbelievable season center DeMarcus Cousins is having, the Kings have the talent to win games. If they can regroup, maybe even man-up in a way we haven't seen the Kings do in ages, they could at least make things interesting down the stretch.\nWhen the NBA resumes late next week, the Golden State Warriors' chase for 73 wins will be front and center, but the bottom half of the West playoff race threatens to get just as interesting.\u00a0"},

But even if their winning percentage is better without the starting power forward, are the Clippers actually a better team with Blake riding the pine?\nDoc Rivers thinks even the premise of that question is egregious:\nThe 18-5 record over that stretch is a tad misleading. The Clippers have played just nine teams with records currently over .500 and many of those are middling Eastern Conference playoff contenders whose records are just barely above sea level.\nFor all the talk of how Griffin, Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan don't play well together,  was still outscoring opponents handily with the three of them on the floor. That's not because of stellar defense, of course; instead, the Clippers score 111.3 points per 100 possessions with their star trio. Just for the sake of comparison, the NBA's best overall offense clocks in at 113 points per 100.\nThat doesn't mean things are perfect, though. The Clippers could certainly use Griffin better within their offense. He's taking more and more long 2s every year, and even if only a couple of those a night turned into 3s, the attack could become that much more efficient. It would help spacing. It would give him some more shots with a better expected points outcome. And if we've conceded that Griffin just isn't going to go inside as much as he once did (whether because of his doing, Rivers' preferences or DeAndre Jordan's propensity to hang around the paint), a few 3s would be the next-best option.\nThat said, the Clippers are hardly broken in the core. They don't have a backup 4. They don't have a backup point guard, though Pablo Prigioni has proven to be serviceable of late. They don't have a consistent, two-way 3. Those are the issues the Clips need to fix most.\nSo, no. Taking away Griffin doesn't make the Clippers better. And it certainly doesn't give them a better chance to beat the Warriors, Spurs or Thunder in the postseason. L.A., who just suspended him for four games for the fighting incident in Toronto, should be anxiously awaiting his return."},

Paul won Rookie of the Year after playing two years at Wake Forest University. He averaged 16.1 points with 7.8 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game.

He also explained that he thinks the rookie has the potential to be a \"very good basketball player\" and that's why he continues to try to develop him. But does Scott think Russell has potential to be as good as Irving and Paul?\nScott has chastised Russell's maturity all season. Last week, he went as far as saying that the rookie is \"not old enough\" to meet with him. Russell is 19, which is the same age Irving was when he was drafted by the Cavaliers.\nWhile some think  from constantly challenging Russell, it's certainly interesting to compare Russell's development with CP3's and Irving's considering all three played for the same coach as a rookie.\u00a0\n"},

The tubes stuck into the side of his chest, the fear of his life being in danger by the blood clot that attacked one of his lungs, the tests that would determine if his career could continue and the searing pain that accompanied each breath all are safely tucked away in the memory bank, and life as Bosh has known it for more than a decade has resumed.\n A year after a blood clot gave the  forward the scare of a lifetime, Bosh is again an All-Star.\n ''It doesn't surprise me,''  coach Erik Spoelstra said. ''I know C.B. probably as well as I've known anybody that I've coached and I know his competitive character. You don't ever want anything like that to happen to anybody in this league. The one thing you can take from it, though, is he has great perspective. I think we all can use that.''\n Bosh is back at the All-Star Game this weekend, and as an added bonus he'll do so in the city where his NBA career began. Only three players who will be taking part in Toronto this weekend - Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade - have more All-Star appearances than Bosh, who has been selected for the league's midseason showcase in each of the last 11 seasons.\n He's even taking part in the 3-point contest on Saturday night, not deterred in the least that at least one Las Vegas sports book lists him as the longest shot in the field of eight. So right now, he's perfectly content looking ahead, not back at the diagnosis that came just days after last year's All-Star weekend ended.\n ''I just put all that stuff behind me,'' Bosh said. ''Once I was free of it, once I stopped having pain, I was like, `Well, OK, I'm out the door and hopefully I won't be back here again.' I appreciate everything more, but that's really it. We can always talk about it. I don't mind talking about it, but personally I just walked away being thankful and leave it at that.''\n Bosh and Wade were on vacation with their wives in Haiti after last year's All-Star events in New York, and Bosh had been dealing with pain in his side for some time. The pain worsened, so Bosh's wife Adrienne insisted that her husband get checked out at a hospital. That's when the clot was found, Bosh's season was declared over and his future seemed most uncertain.\n But this season, he's been good as new.\n Bosh leads the Heat at 19.1 points per game, just ahead of Wade's 18.7 as the two veterans have Miami back in playoff contention. Bosh has also established a career-high in 3-pointers with 81 already, one of the reasons why he's in the long-range contest against the likes of more-traditional 3-point stars like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson of the NBA champion Golden State Warriors.\n ''I don't have anything to lose,'' Bosh said.

He was subsequently hired to be coach Billy Donovan's top assistant with the Thunder.\n Tragedy struck Williams on the eve of this matchup with New Orleans. His wife Ingrid, 44, was killed in a crash just outside of downtown Oklahoma City. Her SUV was hit by an oncoming car that crossed the center line, said police Capt. Paco Valderrama. That driver was pronounced dead at the scene, and an investigation is ongoing.\n \"The Thunder organization has heavy hearts tonight with the news of Ingrid's passing,\" the Thunder said in a statement. \"Words cannot adequately describe how deep our sorrow is for the loss of Monty's wife. Our thoughts and prayers are with Monty and his family, and we will support him in every way possible.\n \"We know the entire community of Oklahoma City has them in their prayers.\"\n The same could be said of the Pelicans, who expressed their condolences following Wednesday's 100-96 win over Utah.\n \"It's just really, really tough when you know a guy like Monty and what he's all about,\" coach Alvin Gentry said. \"Then you realize that it's just a basketball game.

The star forward is scoring 36.3 per game over the last three after scoring 32 on 11-of-21 shooting against the Suns.\n Durant's 27.8 season average is third in the league. He's averaged 30.5 points in his last 11 home meetings with New Orleans (20-32), but a strained left hamstring forced him to miss a 110-103 win Nov. 18.\n Russell Westbrook led the way with 43 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in that meeting. He's had some of the best games of his career recently against the Pelicans, scoring at least 40 in each of the past three meetings while averaging 45.3 on 56.0 percent shooting.\n The Pelicans have followed a four-game slide with consecutive wins.

At 48-4, the Warriors enter the break with the best record through 52 games in NBA history, one win better than the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls and 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers. Those Bulls finished the season with a league-record 72 wins.\n Kerr called his team's record ''shocking.''\n ''Nobody has ever done it, right?'' he said.

''It was really special.''\n Before the opening tip, Bryant hugged Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue, who won two NBA titles as his teammate in Los Angeles.\n Bryant and James started out guarding each other, a matchup NBA fans never got to witness in the Finals and will only see one more time when the Cavs visit the Lakers on March 10.\n Before the game, Bryant said he's never viewed James as a rival.\n ''I never looked to see what he was doing,'' Bryant said. ''I just felt like we were a completely different generation. I just missed that thing completely. Not like a Magic-Bird sort of thing. From the time he came into the league it was more helping him, giving him direction, advice.''\n James said he's sorry he never developed a rivalry with Bryant.\n ''We never had the matchup that everybody wanted, that we wanted,'' he said.\n SAYING GOODBYE\n Bryant said there have great moments and some hard ones to handle during his league-wide farewell tour.\n ''That we stink, that's tough,'' he said. ''But being able to say, `thank you' to the fans, it's tough for me to express how I feel. It's hard to put into words how much I appreciate it.''\n SENSITIVE SHOT\n Lakers rookie D'Angelo Russell got drilled in his groin area by a hard pass thrown by James in the fourth quarter. Russell dropped to the floor and stayed there for several moments before he walked gingerly to the bench, where Bryant was laughing at him.\n ''Once I knew he was OK, the jokes write themselves,'' Bryant said.\n ACHES AND PAINS\n Bryant will make his 16th All-Star game appearance this weekend, but he could use the extra rest.\n ''I feel horrible, my ankles, knees, everything,'' Bryant said. ''This stretch couldn't come at a better time. My ankles hurt. My knees hurt. I'm looking forward to having a complete week where I do nothing.''\n TIP-INS\n Lakers: One of Bryant's roles in his final season is to mentor Russell, the No. 2 overall pick in last year's draft. ''Well, it's like a big brother, or a grandfather,'' Bryant cracked. ''I just talk to him often about the game and the mentality and technique and execution, as well as some of the psychological things that he's going through and how to navigate through those. ... The Lakers have lost eight of nine on the road.\n Cavaliers: G Matthew Dellavedova missed his fifth straight game with left hamstring soreness. ... James entered the night trailing Paul Pierce for 15th place on the NBA's career scoring list. ... Because he's played with Bryant and coached James, Lue is as qualified as anyone to compare the two superstars. ''They're both the same,'' he said. ''Kobe is more ready to fight you, he'll cuss you out. LeBron is more by example.''\n UP NEXT\n Lakers: Host San Antonio on Feb. 19.\n Cavaliers: Host Chicago on Feb. 18."},

Bryant asked, before being told that James has been in the league longer. ''Eleventh year? Thirteenth year! He's a true, true vet. It's strange. To me, it still seems like he just got into the league. Pretty crazy. ... He might retire soon, too.''\n Bryant was at ease during his interview session with reporters before the  played the . This is Bryant's sendoff, his farewell tour, and the 37-year-old is trying to savor every moment.\n When he was in high school and on the verge of becoming a household name, James met Bryant before playing against Carmelo Anthony in an All-Star game in Philadelphia. It was then that Bryant dropped some knowledge on James.\n ''I remember sitting down and talking with him,'' Bryant said. ''The advice I gave him, because he would have so much coming at him, was focus on the game. Stay true to the craft. Everything else would sort out. That was the most important piece of advice I could give him.''\n On several occasions this season, James has spoken with reverence toward Bryant, one of the game's most celebrated players with whom he is often compared. The two didn't always have the strongest connection, but is has matured over the years, helped by them playing together on the U.S. Olympic team.\n Bryant and James once seemed on a collision course to meet in the NBA Finals, but the matchup never materialized, disappointing a basketball world wanting to see the greats go head-to-head with everything on the line.\n ''We never crossed paths unfortunately,'' Bryant said. ''I just wanted to win the damn thing. I didn't care who we played. For the fans it probably stinks because it would have been a great matchup, but from a player's perspective it doesn't matter who you play. ... Just want to win the championship.''\n Bryant recalled previous visits to Cleveland, including the 1997 All-Star Game when he participated in the dunk contest as a rookie. That year the showcased the game's Top 50 players, a who's who of hoops immortality that had Bryant in a daze.\n ''Man, I remember walking around the hotel, I remember walking around this arena, and just running into a great after great after great after great after great,'' Bryant said. ''I grew up watching all of these players. So I watched all of the classic videos, the films, the books. So to see these players all walking around, it was pretty amazing.''\n This weekend, Bryant will take his All-Star bow. It will be the last time he mingles with his peers, who will undoubtedly honor him throughout the festivities in Toronto.\n Bryant's career has come full circle.\n ''I can't wait to be around them and talk to them and see how far the game has progressed, see all this young talent the different generations of players,'' said the 16-time All-Star. ''To me, LeBron is still young. I can't fathom this is his 13th season and the generations that come after him - the Durant generations, the Curry generations. There are so many generations in between that. It's going to be fun for me to be around.\n ''When I first played in an All-Star game, imagine an 18-year-old, 19-year-old kid walking into a locker room and here's John Stockton with his little itty-bitty shorts. There's Barkley. There's Clyde Drexler. There's Gary Payton. I was a 19-year-kid.''"},

''Obviously we're all blessed to play the game of basketball but family comes before that.

The New York Knicks' Kristaps Porzingis has had wonderful first season, and what a story he has been after naive Knicks fans booed him on draft night. But let's make no mistake -- Towns is a monster, and he's the only sane pick for ROY.\nHis huge game Wednesday put the 20-year-old in some elite company, joining\u00a0Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James and Chris Webber as the only players in their 19- 20-year-old seasons to have at least 35 points, 10 rebounds, and three blocks in a game.\u00a0\nTowns is averaging 17.1 points, 10.1 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and 1.4 assists for the season. He's shooting 54.4 percent overall and boasts a true shooting percentage an eyelash below 60 percent. That means the 7-footer can shoot free throws. Wednesday he was 11 of 13 from the foul line, and for the season he's knocking them down at an 85.2-percent rate, which makes him exceedingly dangerous late in games.\nTowns is one of four players in the league this season averaging at least 17.0 points, 10.0 rebounds and 1.5 blocks, joining Pau Gasol, Anthony Davis and Brook Lopez. He's one of just 11 players to average a double-double.\nThe Timberwolves aren't going to make the playoffs again this season, which will extend the longest drought in the NBA to a 12th season.

Then Lowry picked up his fourth foul, Jonas Valanciunas couldn't handle Towns in the paint and the Timberwolves came all the way back to grab the lead early in the fourth quarter.\n\"They're just another team to me,\" Wiggins said when asked if there was something special about beating the team he grew up watching. \"Another team to beat.\"\nCasey emphasized before the game the need for a veteran group to hold it together for one more night before the party starts in Toronto.

We have all the talent. Now we just need to put everything together.\"\n\nTowns joined Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James and Chris Webber as the only players in their 19- or 20-year-old seasons to have at least 35 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in a game. When asked if he surprises himself with his production, Towns quipped, \"I do surprise myself sometimes. Missing two free throws, missing open jump shots.\"\n\nRaptors: Their 68 points were their most in a first half this season. ... Bismack Biyombo left in the second quarter after a nasty spill under the basket but was able to return in the second half. ... The Raptors made 10 of 31 3-pointers to just 4 of 14 for Minnesota.\nTimberwolves: F Tayshaun Prince missed the game to attend former teammate Chauncey Billups' jersey retirement ceremony in Detroit. Zach LaVine started in Prince's place and finished with 13 points. ... Gorgui Dieng had 14 points and 10 rebounds, and all five Timberwolves starters finished in double figures. ...

And though Harden's numbers are almost identical to the ones he posted a year ago, he isn't even in the MVP conversation with the Rockets falling from second-best in the West to .500 at the 54-game marker.\u00a0\nHarden apparently agrees. He said as much Wednesday, via :\nCurry is the clear No. 1 candidate for the MVP this season, outdoing Harden in plenty of categories, but most importantly in wins. His 47-4 Warriors, pacing for the best record of all time, currently hold a baffling 21.5-game lead on the team they defeated in the Western Conference Finals just last season.\nHarden, meanwhile, has sustained criticism for showing up a little out of shape at the start of the season, for contributing to a slow Rockets start, for taking at least some of the blame for the firing of Kevin McHale. He still holds the reasonable title for the NBA's best shooting guard, even as his defense has fallen and his isolation play has come under more fire with the Rockets underperforming. But, as he would put it, all those numbers mean squat when you may not even end up leading a team as talented as Houston's into the postseason."},

Spoelstra didn't want him anywhere around. Whiteside's veteran teammates, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, were again left to lament the big man's unfortunate immaturity, just as he should be all grown up by now at age 26, just as he's on the cusp of striking it rich this summer as an unrestricted free agent.\u00a0\nThere's a reason why Whiteside's salary this season is less than $1 million when the league average is nearly $4.5 million.\nThere's no debate about the value Whiteside's obvious physical talent.

It's run by Jerry Colangelo with an iron fist, and requires very specific actions from players in order to be included in the program's inner circle.\nLillard believed he was on the outside looking in, so when asked about attending the Las Vegas minicamp last summer -- one which Colangelo called \"mandatory\" for players who wanted a chance to be included on the roster for this summer's Rio Olympics -- he didn't hesitate in letting his true feelings be known.\n\"I did it the last few summers and last summer I didn't make it,\" Lillard said at the time\u00a0.\"I don't know why I would go. After I got cut last summer, I don't think I'm a part of it.\"\nUnsurprisingly, Lillard didn't make the cut when the original list of 30 finalists was released.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no hard feelings toward (USA Basketball), but any time I go into a situation, I want to have a real opportunity,\u201d said Lillard in January\u00a0. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to invest myself in something I want to have a real opportunity at it and the last time that I did that I felt like the decision was already made before the decision was made. Whether I played good or bad I didn\u2019t feel like it mattered.\u201d\nIt appears as though Lillard has changed his mind, and decided to make amends. He's been added to the list of finalists, but it took him making a personal phone call to the program's godfather to make it happen.\n\u201cI recently received a call from Damian, and during our conversation he expressed his desire to be considered for the U.S. Olympic Team and to remain involved with the USA National Team in the future as well,\u201d Colangelo said via the official release. \u201cBoth Mike (Krzyzewski) and I feel like Damian is playing at a very high level and that he should be added to our list of Olympic finalists. Damian has been a member of the USA National Team since 2014, and he participated in National Team training camps in 2013 and 2014, so he does have equity in USA Basketball, which is always important to me.\u201d\nThis feels more like a business decision by Lillard than anything else, because this doesn't really change any of the issues he's had with the program in previous years.

Kessel was shelved while battling post-concussion symptoms following the 2014 Sochi Olympics, missing the 2014-15 season after sitting out the previous year in order to train and compete with Team USA. The 2013 winner of the Patty Kazmaier Award as the best women's player in college hockey and a silver medalist in Sochi, Kessel notched a pair of assists in the Gophers' road series against WCHA rival North Dakota, and brings yet another offensive weapon to 25-3-1 Minnesota's high-flying attack.\n\nThe Minnesota senior matched the NCAA's single-game women's scoring record Sunday, scoring a whopping 60 points to lead the Gophers to a double-overtime win over Northwestern. Banham finished 19 of 32 from the field to tie a record that has stood since 1987, six years before she was born. Banham also moved into 24th on the NCAA's all-time scoring list, and now has 2,773 career points for the Gophers. To top it all off, she got a congratulatory tweet from NBA star Kobe Bryant.\n\nA junior forward for the Bulldogs, Iafallo picked up his first multi-point game of the season Friday, scoring twice to lead UMD to a 5-3 win over NCHC foe Colorado College. The New York native was at it again Saturday, scoring the game-winner in the third period of a 3-2 win. Iafallo chipped in Tuesday as well, notching an assist in a 3-2 loss to nonconference rival Bemidji State, and now has 14 points on the season.\n\nThe fourth-year defenseman and rumored trade candidate has a minus-1 rating over his last 10 games, as well as just one assist during that span, but his season hit another speed bump Saturday. The Wild announced that Brodin will be out three to six weeks with a foot injury, complicating both Minnesota's defensive corps and its search for scoring talent in the lead-up to the Feb. 29 trade deadline.\n\nThe Serbian forward was productive in a loss to the Pelicans on Monday, scoring 10 points and grabbing four rebounds despite doing much of his damage with the game out of reach in the fourth quarter, but it's been a rough week for Bjelica otherwise. He was inactive in wins over the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Clippers.\n"},
{"url": "http://www.foxsports.com/fantasy/story/three-burning-fantasy-basketball-questions-feb-10-021016", "text": "\n\n\nMarc Gasol will be sidelined for 4-6 months with a broken right foot, which means you can drop him in all re-draft leagues. It's a tough break for Gasol owners, as his assists (3.8 a game) and free throw percentage (82.9 percent) always gave Gasol sneaky value across the board at the center position. Gasol is a guy who takes nothing off the table, and you can't afford to lose someone like that.\u00a0\nFinding a replacement along those lines can be difficult. Gorgui Dieng is a great option, but he's owned in 70+ percent of most leagues. Robin Lopez isn't a stud, but he'll quietly put up solid numbers in every category if he's available.\u00a0\nOn the lower-owned spectrum, Alex Len is a decent stash. Phoenix has nothing to play for and will want to get him court time. There's always the chance that Tyson Chandler is shipped to a contender, as well, leaving a bunch of minutes for the talented big man to fill.\u00a0\nAgain, you won't be able to replace a guy like Gasol and keep cruising at the same speed. It's probably not a bad idea to look for guys like Dieng who won't hurt you in any category, though, so you don't see much of a drop-off if you're holding onto a top spot.\u00a0\n\nIt's a little early for that, but not too early. We tried to warn you last week about Tyreke Evans, who is debating on whether to go under the knife on his right knee yet again. That would take him out for the year. Try and sell him now and hope that you're trading him to an owner who has his head in the sand.\nWho else is a candidate to get surgery and shut it down? Jimmy Butler is slated to miss the next three or four weeks with a strained knee, and it wouldn't be a surprise if the Bulls pulled the plug on the season at some point while he's out. The Bulls are barely above .500 as it is, and that's with Butler doing nearly all of the heavy lifting. I don't trust Derrick Rose to keep the Bulls afloat, and Pau Gasol is always a threat to miss time. I would sell on Butler right now as well.\u00a0\nBrandon Knight could be unlikely to return this year. He's been dealing with a groin injury all year, and Phoenix has very little to gain by trotting him out there before he's absolutely 100 percent. Knight could put up big scoring numbers as Phoenix's top option should he return, but I'm no optimistic.\u00a0\nIf Kevin Martin isn't dealt at the deadline, he probably won't play much for the young Timberwolves. If Brook Lopez gets nicked up, the Nets won't hesitate to shut him down, either.\nEssentially, any star player or banged up veteran for a non-playoff team is at risk. The players who have proven to be prone to injury (like Lopez, Anthony Davis, etc.) are at an even greater risk. Tread cautiously.\u00a0\n\nIn my mind, it's  point guard Dennis Schroder. There's been talk of the Hawks blowing up their core altogether, but even barring that, it seems unlikely that Atlanta will play out the year with Jeff Teague and Schroder both on the team.\u00a0\nAtlanta seems much more likely to commit to Schroder. He's younger, cheaper, controllable and has a higher ceiling. The Hawks staff has had plenty of time with Teague, and it's pretty clear that it's just not going to work out at an elite level. Schroder has his flaws and can play out of control, but he's earned his chance.\u00a0\nAs the point guard in an offense where he'll have plenty of touches, especially if Al Horford or Paul Millsap are dealt as well, Schroder's arrow is pointing way up. Per 36 minutes he's averaging 18.3 points and 7.9 assists with 4.9 boards, 1.7 threes and 1.7 steals. That's a fantasy stud, even if the percentages and turnovers will burn you a bit.\u00a0\nThere will be nights where he'll frustrate you with mistakes, but he's one of the most exciting young players in the league.\nIf I had to stash one free agent before the deadline who is owned in less than 50 percent of nearly all leagues, it would be Schroder. Go get him.\u00a0"},

I don't think Vlade and I have a disconnect other than we want to win more games than we're winning right now,'' Karl said. ''And that's fine with me. Everyone should want to win more games.''\n Sacramento is 21-31 and has lost eight of its last nine. After Wednesday's game, Karl said the team would go home for the All-Star break to ''regroup and recuperate.''\n Divac said in a statement that Karl ''is our coach and we're collectively working through our issues.''\n He told The Associated Press before the game that the team's defense must improve. Sacramento is allowing a league-worst 109.1 points per game and has given up 120.8 over a four-game losing streak.\n ''Defensively, we are not good,'' Divac said. ''That's something we have to improve big. It would make a difference. Our offense is stable, but defensively we go on and off.''\n Divac said he believes in his players, but didn't rule out adding pieces to help defensively -- or in other areas -- before next Thursday's trading deadline.\n ''We do have what we need, but still like every other organization, if it's something that will improve us we will do it,'' he said. ''But, now, we are happy with the group.''\n Karl declined to offer more specifics about their meeting.\n The coach said speculation about his job won't add extra pressure.\n ''That's your world,'' he said. ''My world is basketball, the gym and players. Your world is interpretation, innuendo, gossip. I'm not into it.''\n Kings star DeMarcus Cousins and Karl have struggled to work together. The All-Star center has not hid his emotions or frustrations.\n Karl says he thinks the team's funk is temporary.\n Meanwhile, he says he won't be bothered by the criticism that comes with losing.\n ''When you're younger, you're always a little more into what people are saying and what people think of you,'' said the 64-year-old Karl, who is coaching his sixth NBA team after time in Cleveland, Golden State, Seattle, Milwaukee and Denver.\n ''As you get older, I think you learn you have no control over that. You can do your job perfectly in this league and if you don't fulfill expectations, you're going to be criticized,'' he said.\n Last year, Karl became the Kings' third coach in one season. He took over following the 2015 All-Star break, succeeding Tyrone Corbin. Corbin had been promoted from top assistant to replace the fired Michael Malone. Karl coached Sacramento to an 11-19 record for the rest of the season.\n The Kings are in 10th place in the Western Conference and haven't made the playoffs in 10 years."},

What's not to like?\nIn 2007, Kobe was 28 years old and had just dropped 32 points per game on helpless defenders. LeBron was 22 and just finished his one-man show in the playoffs, leading a talent-starved  roster to the Finals.\nSo why wouldn't the Cavs send The King to the  for the Mamba in a  by the Lakers in the summer of 2007?\nForget the fact that LeBron was six years younger and was the franchise's hometown hero (though those two reasons were probably enough for the Cavs to balk at the deal.) LeBron's ability to do more with less could not be ignored.\nLeBron led that Cavs team in scoring (27.3 per game), assists (6.7) and steals (1.6) while finishing third in rebounds (6.7). He was asked to do virtually everything on a roster that lacked another offensive weapon.\nIt wasn't like Kobe, who had championship three rings at the time, was swimming in talent on his roster either (Luke Walton was the third-leading scorer!) But the one thing the Mamba did have was Lamar Odom, who averaged 16 points, 10 rebounds and five assists that season. Odom was easily better than any option LeBron had on his team. Odom's versatility and ability to handle the ball provided Kobe with a true No. 2 option.\nThe Cavs' second-leading scorer was Larry Hughes at 15 points per game. Hughes played mostly shooting guard, leaving LeBron to shoulder most of the ball-handling duties.\nLeBron's ability to carry this team was on full display against the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. He scored 48 points, including 29 of the Cavs' final 30, against one of the best defensive teams at the time despite the Pistons knowing he was really the only real scoring option. But LeBron still showed trust in that roster, averaging eight assists during that run playoff run.\nKobe was no joke either in the 2007 playoffs. Despite the Lakers losing 4-1 to the Phoenix Suns in the first round, the Mamba averaged 33 points. It just wasn't enough against a Suns team that won 61 games that season.\nKobe's ability to score is undeniable, especially at that point in his career. He was at the height of his powers, virtually unstoppable one on one. But he was never known -- even now at the end of his career -- as a player who would get his teammates involved offensively. Would he have shown the same trust LeBron did in that Cavs roster? Doubtful at best.\nBut remember, Kobe was fuming because he wanted to win. Despite the Cavs reaching the Finals in 2007, Kobe, who had a no-trade clause, would have seen the flaws in their roster and balked at the move despite facing an easier path to the Finals in the East.\nBut forget the on-court debate. How would Kobe react playing in Cleveland? The Cavs had to have known that if Kobe wasn't happy playing in Tinseltown with the Lakers, how could it ever have worked out in Cleveland?\n\"I never would've approved it. Never. The trade to go to Cleveland? Never,\" Bryant told ESPN's Baxter Holmes this week. \"That wasn't one of the teams that was on my list. It was Chicago, San Antonio [or] Phoenix.\"\nIn the end, the Cavs made the right decision, though really there wasn't any real decision to make. LeBron's importance to that franchise -- that city -- meant he was untouchable in a way that many NBA stars aren't. No knock on Kobe, but for the Cavs, this one was a no-brainer."},

I just felt like we were completely different generations. I just missed that thing completely. Not like a Magic and Bird sort of thing. It was more like, from the time he came in the league it was more helping him, giving him direction, advice, 'cause I was just so much older by NBA years. So no, I've never had that.\"\nBryant and James have been the two faces of the NBA for quite some time -- ever since LeBron entered the league in the 2003-04 season. But the Black Mamba and King James have never faced each other with a title on the line.\nSo is it weird to Bryant that he's never met James in the Finals?\n\"I wouldn't say weird,\" Bryant said. \"It's just, I don't know if weird would be the term I'd use for it. Our teams, just, we never crossed paths unfortunately. I don't want to say it was weird or anything like that. Just the ebb and flows of each season.\"\nUnfortunate is right. A Kobe vs. LeBron Finals is the kind of matchup that NBA fans dream of, but Bryant isn't losing sleep over what could have been.\n\"It didn't matter to me,\" Bryant said of his NBA Finals opponents. \"I just wanted to win the damn thing. I didn't care who we played. For the fans, it probably stinks because it would have been a great matchup, but from a player's perspective it doesn't matter who you play. Just want to win the championship.\"\nAnd that he did, five of them.\nBut Bryant will never catch Michael Jordan's six rings. And, for that matter, he'll never catch LeBron's MVP count, either (James has four, Kobe one). At the end of the day, the 37-year-old's comments shouldn't be seen as disrespectful in any way. Bryant simply never looked up to a younger player who ultimately had to change organizations to win it all.\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that.\nOf course, there's also a chance Bryant isn't being totally honest, and it killed him to watch James unofficially take his spot atop the league's totem pole. But all we can go by is what the man says."},

''I'm not 100 percent sure. Like I've been saying the last two years I'm taking it year-by-year. But this could possibly be.''\n Pierce said in each of his previous visits to Boston since leaving in 2013, the feeling when he returns remains the same.\n ''It's always special when I step on the Garden,'' he said. ''This has been the bulk of my career. You spend 15 years here...memories of winning a championship here. It's a special feeling. Special fans. Special building. I always savor the moments when I step on this court.''\n Pierce was given the start by Clippers coach Doc Rivers Wednesday, which resulted in a huge eruption by the Garden fans when his name was announced. Pierce acknowledged them, raising his right hand before his teammates started playfully pounding on him.\n When Pierce started his career in Boston in 1998, fans thought there were getting a steal with limitless upside. Ten years later he not only fulfilled that expectation, but delivered the franchise's 17th championship as part of the Big Three tandem of Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, himself.\n After playing more than 1,100 games and scoring more than 24,000 points in his Boston tenure, he returned Wednesday for his eighth career game against the Celtics as a 38-year-old and role player on a Los Angeles Clippers team that is in the mix to challenge for another title.\n He's also reunited with Rivers - his former Celtics coach - who credited Pierce with having the most impact on their title run in 2008.\n ''He went through more than any of us,'' Rivers said. ''He went through tough times before I got here. We went through tough times together. Yet he's one of those guys that never asked to leave, he never wanted to bail. He stuck it out and he got rewarded for it.''\n As for his role with the Clippers, Rivers said Pierce has not only embraced the idea of being a role player, but Rivers had leaned on him to help impart wisdom that would normally fall on the coach's shoulders.\n ''He gives us leadership. He gives us truth. Instead of me using my voice, I can use Paul's voice. That's been nice. It's a different team than the one here. This is a young team and a team that's trying to get over the hump. So Paul's been really good.''\n This season not only could be the final one for Pierce, but possibly for Garnett, who is 39.\n ''I don't know what his plans and I don't know what I'm doing,'' Pierce said. ''But this could be the last time, who knows?''\n One thing he hasn't ruled out is coming back to Boston once he's finished playing - whenever that is.\n ''I think all possibilities are open. If that is an opportunity that presents itself I would love to,'' Pierce said. ''Who knows, maybe I'll find a role here someday in the future.''\n ---\n Follow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower"},

Curry leads the league in true shooting percentage, despite being the focus of the defense on a nightly basis. And the reason for that is because it doesn't seem to take him any time at all to release his shot.\nThanks to , we now have some data to show just how insanely quick Curry's shooting motion is.\n\"That\u2019s probably the most interesting [measurement],\u201d Curry told FOX Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I feel is very natural in how I play the game. And being 6-foot-3 in NBA terms is still kind of short, so I still have to use that speed and quickness to get my shot off.\u00a0\n\"Obviously I\u2019m not out there on the court thinking I\u2019ve got [however many] seconds to get a shot off, it\u2019s just how I play. And to have that analyzed by science is pretty cool, and to see how that actually works. It just gives me more incentive to keep working on it and maybe get a little faster.\u201d\nThe analytics on Curry provided by the Degree MotionSense Lab are obviously specific to him. But he says he's very open to reviewing any advanced data that might be available which could help him with his game, and the Warriors are among the organizations that are doing their best in this regard to help their players out.\u00a0\n\u201cWe get a lot more [data] than we used to,\u201d Curry told FOX Sports. \u201cWe wear wearable technology during practice and it tells you how far you run, the different load you put on your body through practice and things like that. And then with the in-game analytics that they have -- actually my favorite one is . If I move from one side of the court, do three guys move with me? Do I draw that much attention? I understand a lot more than I probably did last year or two years ago, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll continue because it\u2019s valuable information to know.\n\"You don\u2019t want to be overloaded by it, but if you\u2019re really trying to understand the game and how to get better, and learn different ways you can get a leg up on the competition?

And his most recent issue was Tuesday with him ejected for throwing an elbow in the fourth quarter against San Antonio.\n\"Sometimes,\" Heat guard Dwyane Wade said, \"we don't know what he's thinking.\"\nWhatever Whiteside was thinking on Tuesday when he threw the elbow to the head of San Antonio's Boban Marjanovic isn't known. Whiteside was sent home by team officials before reporters arrived in the locker room, and the Heat won't practice again until Feb. 17. That's one day before the NBA's trade deadline, and the Heat will have to decide whether to trade him now and try to get something back or risk losing him this summer for nothing.\nGetting kicked out a game again -- Tuesday's was his third ejection in 93 games with the Heat -- doesn't help his cause.\n\"That's something that we'll deal with,\" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who wasn't hiding his displeasure.\nWade and took great pains during his postgame comments to hammer home the point that his teammates are still there for Whiteside and want to help him. They also want to be able to count on him, and that isn't always the case.\n\"You can always help a guy or try to give a guy advice,\" said Heat forward Chris Bosh, whose locker is next to Whiteside's and that means he's in his ear more than most. \"People have given me advice over my career. I think the next step for him is really learning about reputation. Unfortunately, he's taken a step back.\"\nWhiteside was picked up off the NBA's scrap heap by the Heat last season, and things eventually clicked like Miami had gotten a steal. No NBA player blocked more shots in regular-season games in 2015, and he had as many triple-doubles in those 12 months as LeBron James -- only five players had more. A guy who had to play in Lebanon and China when no one in the NBA wanted him seemed like he finally arrived.\nAnd he's had some games this season that were statistically impressive. He's gotten double-figure rebounds in 29 of his 45 games, at least five blocks in 16 games, shot 70 percent or better in 15 games.\nBut Miami has had 23 games this season in which there's been a margin of four points or less in the last two minutes. Whiteside has played in only eight of those games, according to STATS.\n\"Coach is going to make the decisions he's going to make,\" Whiteside said earlier this week. \"I can't control that. He's the coach.\"\nWhiteside's talent isn't questioned. But things like complaining about calls, lobbying for a better video-game rating, a penchant for in-game pouting and of late boasting that he was driving a car that could exceed 200 mph -- though he never suggested he was driving that fast and only pointed to the speedometer display during one of his Snapchat videos -- are all things the Heat are surely noticing.\nSome team will probably give Whiteside a big contract this summer. It just might not be Miami, and if he makes it past the trade deadline the final 29 games of the Heat season could be his final chance to impress.\n\"He knows what he means to the team,\" Bosh said. \"He knows that he has to keep his head in every situation. ... He wants to win. We just have to encourage him and keep telling him what it takes to win.\""},
