How information __flows__ between the different parts of __an__ organization and its customers __is__ illustrated in __Figure__ 2. Relations between PMs and customers include __the__ management of requirements (1) and strategical issues, e.g. negotiations regarding what other suppliers and Ericsson can deliver. Usually, R&D and customers do no cummunicate directly, instead the information flows either through PMs or PIDS depending the matter; if a customer wants to know more about a specific features and how they work (3) or if R&D wants more information from __customers__ regarding __the__ requested features or trouble reports to be corrected. Additionally, PIDS selects a collaboration custom (5), __executes__ live tests on customer __sites__ and finally puts the release out for general availability to all the customers.

..Boehm and Turner created __a__ framework for __an__ adapted project[5]. They recognized that both agile and plan-based methods __have__ short-coming which if unaddressed can lead to __ project failure. The frameworks constitute __a__ five step model where risk is used for structuring __projects__ in order to incorporate both agile and plan-based practices. First, risk analysis is used to specify risk areas in relation to agile and plan-based methods, categorized into environmental, agila and plan-driven risks. Secon, the risks are evaluated to determine whether or not the project should use a pure agile or pure plan-based methodology. Third, given that __the__ project is unsuitable for a purely agile of plan-based approach, an architecture is developed that __supports__ agile methods where their strenghts are exploited and weaknesses minimized. Fourth, a risk management and resolution strategy __is__ developed. Finally, __the__ project attributes are monitored in order to enable proper adjustments __towards__ either agility or planning during __the__ project life time.
