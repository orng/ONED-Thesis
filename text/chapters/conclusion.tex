\label{chapter:conclusion}
We have presented the basis for a novel approach to ONED based on finding minimal new subsets from incoming news article. Through experiments we have examined the feasibility of such an approach being used for successful ONED. Furthermore we have presented and tested some ideas for further improving the data outputted by the base approach. We believe that the results of our experiments support the idea that minimal new sets could be good indicators of new events within news articles and we have shown that our current system could potentially be used for tool assisted event detection which would allow users to quickly scan through enumerations of articles and detect new events. However, further work is required in order to develop the system into a fully automatic ONED system.
