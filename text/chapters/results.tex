\chapter{Results}
\label{chapter:results}
In this chapter we will look at the results of the experiments discussed in chapter~\ref{chapter:experiments}.

\Crefrange{tab:d1}{tab:d4} show the ratio of articles which resulted in no new words, no new pairs or both. In the cases where filtering was applied, a shorthand for the filter type (cf=collection frequency, tf=term frequency) is included as well as the threshold. We noted that filtering did in fact increase the number of empty output-sets of either size and in the cases of the collection frequency and term frequency filters along with any pre-enumeration filtering (Configuration-3) the change was quite drastic.

One of the events touched upon in the D2 dataset is the BP-oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill}} and president Obama's actions revolving that incident. \Crefrange{lst:original}{lst:config6} show the enumerations of an article in which the event was mentioned for the second time, enumerated using different configurations. In this case the event would be that president Obama answered questions regarding the oil spill.

As is to be expected, the enumerations using Configuration-2 and Configuration-4 are very similar since most of the articles in the dataset only contain one sentence and therefore only one sub-bag. Apart from the enumeration generated by Configuration-3 which contains no useful insights about the contents of the article, the generated enumerations appear to capture the main gist of the article. For configurations 1,3 and 4 the minimal new sets have been sorted based on TF-IDF score, in descending order.

\Crefrange{fig:setPlot1}{fig:setPlot4} show how the amount of minimal new sets of size less than 3 found in enumeration change over time using different configurations. In all cases the amount of new words found decreases over time while the amount of new pairs found tends to increase over time.

\section{Benchmarks}
For each configuration we measured the time taken to process each of the datasets. Although each run produced the same output we performed each test 20 times to achieve more accurate benchmarks. \Cref{tab:benchmark1} shows the average time per article for different configurations. \Cref{tab:benchmark2} shows the combined average time per article for the same configurations for configurations using sub-bags and vice versa.

  \begin{table}[ht]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
    \hline
    Configuration & time/article (s)  \\ \hline
    Configuration-1                     & 0.3909 \\ \hline
    Configuration-2 (tfidf: 15)         & 0.2939 \\ \hline
    Configuration-4                     & 0.0533 \\ \hline
