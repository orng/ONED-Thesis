\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}
I'd like to thank my supervisor, prof. Peter Damaschke, for the idea for this project and assistance and insights throughout the course of this project.

I'd also like to thank my family for supporting and encouraging me throughout the course of this project. I would especially like to thank my wife, Elfa Bj√∂rk, for her patience and support without which this thesis would never have been completed.
