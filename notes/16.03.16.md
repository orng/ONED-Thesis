Filtered words based on following approach: 
  keep track of how often a word appears. Filter top 10% most common words

Second approach:
  Same as above only now we count in how many articles a word appears.

Third approach:
  Same as the two above except, this time we only filter based on previous articles, that is we find the most common words based on the articles that we have seen before the current one. In the previous approaches we took into account the articles themselves.

Fourth approach:
  Use tf-idf and filter all words below a threshold.
