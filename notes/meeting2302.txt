TODO:
    Implement more efficient algorithm
    Examine the results manually on shorter texts. Perhaps the first paragraph of the articles or other sources.
    Possible following steps: depend on outcome of step 2:
        if satisfactory: perhaps optimize runtime of algorithm
        if not refine the method somehow.
    Time permitting we look into the optimization problem.

DEADLINES: send weekly reports to Peter before each monday.
