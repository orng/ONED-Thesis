A system for new event detection
Brants, Chen and Farahat


Approach
  Basic model
    tf-idf weighting
    either Hellinger distance or cosine distance used for similarity calculations
    each document compared to all others using the distance function, if score above threshold then mark as new.
    Short documents eliminated since they are likely to just be announcements and not contain any event.

  Improved Model
    use source-specific tf-idf model, since certain words are more common within particular sources, such as the names of shows that air on the same network etc.
    ajust (normalize) similarity calculations by subtracting average similarity of current document to all other documents.
    Ajust weights within ROIs, e.g. U.S. midterm elections and mexican presidential elections will contain similar words.
    Check for segment overlapping using sliding window.
