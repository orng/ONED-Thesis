On-line New Event Detection and Tracking
Allan, Papka and Lavrenko

What is an event?
  somthing that happens at a particular time and place.
  Event perhaps not entire straightforward, "the OJ Simpson saga" might be considered an event.o

Method:
  1. use feature extraction and selection techniques to build a query representation for the story's content
  2. determine the query's initial threshold by evaluation the new story with the query
  3. compare the new story against eatiler queries in memory
  4. if the story does not trigger any previous query by exceeding its threshold, flag as new
  5. if the sotry triggers existing query, flag as old
  6. (optional) add story to agglomeration list of queries it triggered
  7. (optional) rebuild existing queris using the story
  8. add new query to memory

  thresholds for comparisons can be function of time elapsed between stories.

Article also presents evaluation methodology to use for measuring performance of NED approach.

**NOTE**: our implementation will not be useful for event tracking. If we correctly flag a story as old we won't really be able to tell what story first reported the event and what other stories have reported the same event.
