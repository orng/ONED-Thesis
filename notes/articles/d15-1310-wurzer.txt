Twitter-scale New Event Detection via K-term Hashing

Approach operates in constant time/space and scales to very high volume streams. While others become progressiveily slower with each processed document.

**NOTE: mentions LSH buckets (Petrovic et al. 2010)
as attempt to speed up ONED that isn't clustering.

Approach:
  Document novelty is estimated as the proportion of sets containing k-terms from the document that have not appeared before.

**NOTE**: SOUNDS REALLY SIMILAR TO OUR APPROACH!
