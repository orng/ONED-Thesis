On-Line New Event Detection using Single Pass Clustering
Allan and Papka

Single pass Clustering algorithm with a novel thresholding model.

Can be difficult to determine the accurate definition of an event, it is easier to define the properties that specify when two events are the same. These properties define *event identity*.

Algorithm:
  1. Use feature extraction and selection techniques to build a query representation for the document's content
  2. Determine the query's initial threshold by evaling the new doc with the query.
  3. Compare the new doc agains previous queries in memory
  4. If doc doesnt trigger previous query by exceeding threshold flag as new
  5. else flag as old
  6. (optional) add doc to agglomoration list of queries it triggered
  7. (optional) rebuild existing queries using the doc    8. add new doc to memory.
