A Study on Retrospective and On-Line Event Detection
Yang, Pierce and Carbonell

Event detection is essentially a discovery problem i.e., *mining the data stream* for new patterns in document content.

- Clustering, bottom up. can result in cluster hierarhcy which allows many levels of abstraction in the informaiont space to be observered.

- Observations:
  - news stories discussing the same event tend to be temporally proximate 
  - time gap between bursts of topically similar storis is often an indication of different eventso
  - A significant vocabulary shift and rapid changes in term frequency distributino are typical of stories reporing a new event, indicating the importance of dynamically updateing the corpus vocabulare and statistical term weights. A timely recognition of new patterns, including previously unseen proper names an proximity phrases, in the streams of stories is potentially useful for detection of the onset of a new event.:

Approach:
  Innvestigated two clustering methods: hierarchical based on *group-average-clustering* and one single-pass algorithm (incremental clustering). The former is for retrospective detection, the latter for both retrospective and on-line.

A document is represented using a vector of weighted terms (words or phrases). Normalized vector sum of documents in cluster represents cluster (the centroid). Terms weighted with tf-idf and normalized. Only keep k top-ranking terms per vector and discard rest.

For on-line used incremental IDF:
first 'train' on some dataset and then update IDF for each document. IDF uses log2 not log10 like we do.

Time window to limit prior context to m previous stories. Similarity score of each doc in time window computed. Flagged as new if all similarity scores are below threshold.
Also tested decay weighting where documents further away in time are marked as less important.

Preprocessing:
  remove stopwords, stemming, term weighting.
